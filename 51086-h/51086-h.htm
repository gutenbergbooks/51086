<h2>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THIS book is named after my son who was killed in
the War.</p>

<p>It is divided into three parts. In the first part some idea of the
kind of life lived and the spirit shown by any number of youths, fully
engaged in civil occupations, who joined for service when war broke out
and went to the Front, is illustrated by extracts from his letters.
The object of this portion is to engender a friendly feeling towards
the writer of the letters, so that whatever more has to be said in
the sequel may not have the inevitable dulness of details concerning
an entire stranger. This is the sole object of this portion. The
letters are not supposed to be remarkable; though as a picture of part
of the life at the Front during the 1915 phase of the war they are
interesting, as many other such letters must have been.</p>

<p>The second part gives specimens of what at present are considered by
most people unusual communications; though these again are in many
respects of an ordinary type, and will be recognised as such by other
bereaved persons who have had similar messages. In a few particulars,
indeed, those here quoted have rather special features, by reason of
the assistance given by the group of my friends "on the other side"
who had closely studied the subject. It is partly owing to the urgency
therein indicated that I have thought it my duty to speak out, though
it may well be believed that it is not without hesitation that I have
ventured thus to obtrude family affairs. I should not have done so were
it not that the amount of premature and unnatural bereavement at the
present time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
is so appalling that the pain caused by exposing one's
own sorrow and its alleviation, to possible scoffers, becomes almost
negligible in view of the service which it is legitimate to hope may
thus be rendered to mourners, if they can derive comfort by learning
that communication across the gulf is possible. Incidentally I have
to thank those friends, some of them previously unknown, who have in
the same spirit allowed the names of loved ones to appear in this
book, and I am grateful for the help which one or two of those friends
have accorded. Some few more perhaps may be thus led to pay critical
attention to any assurance of continued and happy and useful existence
which may reach them from the other side.</p>

<p>The third part of the book is of a more expository character, and is
designed to help people in general to realise that this subject is
not the bugbear which ignorance and prejudice have made it, that it
belongs to a coherent system of thought full of new facts of which
continued study is necessary, that it is subject to a law and order of
its own, and that though comparatively in its infancy it is a genuine
branch of psychological science. This third part is called "Life and
Death," because these are the two great undeniable facts which concern
everybody, and in which it is natural for every one to feel a keen
interest, if they once begin to realise that such interest is not
futile, and that it is possible to learn something real about them. It
may be willingly admitted that these chapters are inadequate to the
magnitude of the subject, but it is hoped that they are of a usefully
introductory character.</p>

<p>The "In Memoriam" chapter of Part I is no doubt
chiefly of interest to family and friends; but everybody
is very friendly, and under the circumstances it will be
excused.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE bare facts are much as reported in <i>The
Times</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Second Lieutenant Raymond Lodge</span> was the youngest son of
Sir Oliver and Lady Lodge, and was by taste and training an
engineer. He volunteered for service in September 1914 and was
at once given a commission in the 3rd South Lancashires. After
training near Liverpool and Edinburgh, he went to the Front in
the early spring of 1915, attached to the 2nd South Lancashire
Regiment of the Regular Army, and was soon in the trenches near
Ypres or Hooge. His engineering skill was of service in details of
trench construction, and he later was attached to a Machine-Gun
Section for a time, and had various escapes from shell fire and
shrapnel. His Captain having sprained an ankle, he was called back
to Company work, and at the time of his death was in command of
a Company engaged in some early episode of an attack or attempted
advance which was then beginning. He was struck by a fragment
of shell in the attack on Hooge Hill on the 14th September 1915,
and died in a few hours.</p>

<p>Raymond Lodge had been educated at Bedales School and
Birmingham University. He had a great aptitude and love for
mechanical engineering, and was soon to have become a partner
with his elder brothers, who highly valued his services, and
desired his return to assist in the Government work which now
occupies their firm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In amplification of this bare record a few members of
the family wrote reminiscences of him, and the following
memoir is by his eldest brother:&mdash;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">MOST lives have marriages, births of children, productive years; but
the lives of the defenders of their Country are short and of majestic
simplicity. The obscure records of childhood, the few years of school
and university and constructive and inventive work, and then the sudden
sacrifice of all the promise of the future, of work, of home, of love;
the months of hard living and hard work well carried through, the
cheerful humorous letters home making it out all very good fun; and in
front, in a strange ruined and desolate land, certain mutilation or
death. And now that death has come.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>My brother was born at Liverpool on January 25th, 1889, and was at
Bedales School for five or six years, and afterwards at Birmingham
University, where he studied engineering and was exceptionally
competent in the workshop. He went through the usual two years'
practical training at the Wolseley Motor Works, and then entered his
brothers' works, where he remained until he obtained a commission at
the outbreak of war.</p>

<p>His was a mind of rare stamp. It had unusual power,
unusual quickness, and patience and understanding of
difficulties in my experience unparalleled, so that he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
able to make anyone understand really difficult things.
I think we were most of us proudest and most hopeful of
him. Some of us, I did myself, sometimes took problems
technical or intellectual to him, sure of a wise and
sound solution.</p>

<p>Though his chief strength lay on the side of mechanical and electrical
engineering it was not confined to that. He read widely, and liked good
literature of an intellectual and witty but not highly imaginative
type, at least I do not know that he read Shelley or much of William
Morris, but he was fond of Fielding, Pope, and Jane Austen. Naturally
he read Shakespeare, and I particularly associate him with <i>Twelfth
Night</i> and <i>Love's Labour's Lost</i>. Among novelists, his favourites,
after Fielding and Miss Austen, were I believe Dickens and Reade; and
he frequently quoted from the essays and letters of Charles Lamb.
<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Of the stories of his early childhood, and his overflowing vitality
made many, I was too often from home to be able to speak at large. But
one I may tell. Once when a small boy at Grove Park, Liverpool, he
jumped out of the bath and ran down the stairs with the nurse after
him, out of the front door, down one drive along the road and up the
other, and was safely back in the bath again before the horrified
nursemaid could catch up with him. [<i>body of Memoir incomplete, and
omitted here.</i>]</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>That death is the end has never been a Christian doctrine, and evidence
collected by careful men in our own day has, perhaps needlessly,
upheld with weak props of experiment the mighty arch of Faith. Death
is real and grievous, and is not to be tempered by the glossing
timidities of those who would substitute journalese like "passing-on,"
"passing-over," etc., for that tremendous word: but it is the end of a
stage, not the end of the journey. The road stretches on beyond that
inn, and beyond our imagination, "the moonlit endless way."</p>

<p>Let us think of him then, not as lying near Ypres with
all his work ended, but rather, after due rest and refreshment,
continuing his noble and useful career in more peaceful
surroundings, and quietly calling us his family from
paralysing grief to resolute and high endeavour.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is not right that we should weep for a death
like his. Rather let us pay him our homage in praise and
imitation, by growing like him and by holding our lives
lightly in our Country's service, so that if need be we may
die like him. This is true honour and his best memorial.</p>

<p>Not that I would undervalue those of brass or stone,
for if beautiful they are good and worthy things. But fame
illuminates memorials, and fame has but a narrow circle
in a life of twenty-six years.</p>

<h3>REMINISCENCES BY O. J. L.</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">OF all my sons, the youngest, when he was small, was most like myself
at the same age. In bodily appearance I could recognise the likeness
to my early self, as preserved in old photographs; an old schoolfellow
of mine who knew me between the ages of eight and eleven, visiting
Mariemont in April 1904, remarked on it forcibly and at once, directly
he saw Raymond&mdash;then a schoolboy; and innumerable small mental traits
in the boy recalled to me my childhood's feelings. Even an absurd
difficulty he had as a child in saying the hard letters&mdash;the hard G and
K&mdash;was markedly reminiscent of my own similar difficulty.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity which we shared in childhood was dislike of
children's parties&mdash;indeed, in my own case, a party of any kind. I
remember being truly miserable at a Christmas party at The Mount,
Penkhull, where I have no doubt that every one was more than
friendly,&mdash;though probably over-patronising, as people often are
with children,&mdash;but where I determinedly abstained from supper, and
went home hungry. Raymond's prominent instance was at the hospitable
Liverpool house, "Greenbank," which the Rathbones annually delivered
up to family festivities each Christmas afternoon and evening, being
good enough to include us in their family group. On one such occasion
Raymond, a very small boy, was found in the hall making a bee-line for
the front door and home. I remember sympathising with him, from ancient
memories, and taking him home, subsequently returning myself.</p>

<p>At a later stage of boyhood I perceived that his ability and tastes
were akin to mine, for we had the same passionate love of engineering
and machinery; though in my case, having no opportunity of exercising
it to any useful extent, it gradually turned into special aptitude for
physical science. Raymond was never anything like as good at physics,
nor had he the same enthusiasm for mathematics that I had, but he
was better at engineering, was in many ways I consider stronger in
character, and would have made, I expect, a first-rate engineer. His
pertinacious ability in the mechanical and workshop direction was very
marked. Nothing could have been further from his natural tastes and
proclivities than to enter upon a military career; nothing but a sense
of duty impelled him in that direction, which was quite foreign to
family tradition, at least on my side.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i_023"></a>

<div class="caption">RAYMOND WHEN TWO YEARS OLD</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[ 9]</a></span></p>

<p>He also excelled me in a keen sense of humour&mdash;not
only appreciation, but achievement. The whole family
could not but admire and enjoy the readiness with which
he perceived at once the humorous side of everything; and
he usually kept lively any gathering of which he was a unit.
At school, indeed, his active wit rather interfered with the
studies of himself and others, and in the supposed interests
of his classmates it had to be more or less suppressed, but
to the end he continued to be rather one of the wags of the
school.</p>

<p>Being so desperately busy all my life I failed to see
as much as I should like either of him or of the other
boys, but there was always an instinctive sympathy between
us; and it is a relief to me to be unable to remember
any, even a single, occasion on which I have been vexed
with him. In all serious matters he was, as far as I could
judge, one of the best youths I have ever known; and
we all looked forward to a happy life for him and a brilliant
career.</p>

<p>His elder brothers highly valued his services in their
Works. He got on admirably with the men; his mode
of dealing with overbearing foremen at the Works,
where he was for some years an apprentice, was testified
to as masterly, and was much appreciated by his
"mates"; and honestly I cannot bethink myself of any
trait in his character which I would have had different&mdash;unless
it be that he might have had a more thorough liking
and aptitude for, and greater industry in, my own subject
of physics.</p>

<p>When the war broke out his mother and I were in
Australia, and it was some time before we heard that he
had considered it his duty to volunteer. He did so in
September 1914, getting a commission in the Regular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[ 10]</a></span>
Army which was ante-dated to August; and he threw
himself into military duties with the same ability and
thoroughness as he had applied to more naturally congenial
occupations. He went through a course of training at
Great Crosby, near Liverpool, with the Regiment in which
he was a Second Lieutenant, namely the 3rd South
Lancashires, being attached to the 2nd when he went to
the Front; his Company spent the winter in more active
service on the south coast of the Firth of Forth and Edinburgh;
and he gained his desired opportunity to go out
to Flanders on 15 March 1915. Here he applied his engineering
faculty to trench and shelter construction, in addition
to ordinary military duties; and presently he became a
machine-gun officer. How desperately welcome to the family
his safe return would have been, at the end of the war,
I need not say. He had a hard and strenuous time at the
Front, and we all keenly desired to make it up to him by
a course of home "spoiling." But it was too much to hope
for&mdash;though I confess I did hope for it.</p>

<p>He has entered another region of service now; and this
we realise. For though in the first shock of bereavement
the outlook of life felt irretrievably darkened, a perception
of his continued usefulness has mercifully dawned
upon us, and we know that his activity is not over. His
bright ingenuity will lead to developments beyond what
we could have anticipated; and we have clear hopes for
the future.</p>

<h3>A MOTHER'S LAMENT</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Written on a scrap of paper, September 26, 1915</i>,<br /><br />
"<i>To ease the pain and to try to get in touch</i>"<br /><br /></p>

<p class="drop-cap">RAYMOND, darling, you have gone from our world,
and <i>oh</i>, to ease the pain. I want to know if you
are happy, and that you <i>yourself</i> are really talking
to me and no sham.</p>

<p>"No more letters from you, my own dear son, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[ 11]</a></span>
I have loved them so. They are all there; we shall have
them typed together into a sort of book.</p>

<p>"Now we shall be parted until I join you there. I
have not seen as much of you as I wanted on this earth,
but I do love to think of the bits I have had of you,
specially our journeys to and from Italy. I had you to
myself then, and you were so dear.</p>

<p>"I want to say, dear, how we recognise the glorious
way in which you have done your duty, with a certain
straight pressing on, never letting anyone see the effort, and
with your fun and laughter playing round all the time,
cheering and helping others. You know how your brothers
and sisters feel your loss, and your poor father!"</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p class="drop-cap">THE religious side of Raymond was hardly known to the
family; but among his possessions at the Front was found a
small pocket Bible called "The Palestine Pictorial Bible" (Pearl
24mo), Oxford University Press, in which a number of passages are
marked; and on the fly-leaf, pencilled in his writing, is an index
to these passages, which page I copy here:&mdash;</p>

<h3>EXTRACTS FROM PLATO'S DIALOGUE<br />
"MENEXENUS"</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Being part of a Speech in honour of those who had<br />
died in Battle for their Country</span>
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AND I think that I ought now to repeat the message
which your fathers, when they went out
to battle, urged us to deliver to you who are their
survivors, in case anything happened to them. I will tell
you what I heard them say, and what, if they could, they
would fain be saying now, judging from what they then
said; but you must imagine that you hear it all from their
lips. Thus they spoke:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Sons, the event proves that your fathers were brave
men. For we, who might have continued to live, though
without glory, choose a glorious death rather than bring
reproach on you and your children, and rather than disgrace
our fathers and all of our race who have gone before
us, believing that for the man who brings shame on his
own people life is not worth living, and that such an one
is loved neither by men nor gods, either on earth or in
the underworld when he is dead.</p>

<p>"Some of us have fathers and mothers still living, and
you must encourage them to bear their trouble, should it
come, as lightly as may be; and do not join them in lamentations,
for they will have no need of aught that would
give their grief a keener edge. They will have pain
enough from what has befallen them. Endeavour rather
to soothe and heal their wound, reminding them that of
all the boons they ever prayed for the greatest have been
granted to them. For they did not pray that their sons
should live for ever, but that they should be brave and
of fair fame. Courage and honour are the best of all
blessings, and while for a mortal man it can hardly be
that everything in his own life will turn out as he would
have it, their prayer for those two things has been heard.
Moreover, if they bear their troubles bravely, it will be perceived
that they are indeed fathers of brave sons, and
that they themselves are like them.... So minded, <i>we</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[ 14]</a></span>
at any rate, bid those dear to us to be; such we would have
them be; and such we say we are now showing that we
ourselves are, neither grieving overmuch nor fearing overmuch
if we are to die in this battle. And we entreat our
fathers and mothers to continue to be thus minded for the
rest of their days, for we would have them know that it is
not by bewailing and lamentation that they will please us
best. If the dead have any knowledge of the living, they
will give us no pleasure by breaking down under their
trouble, or by bearing it with impatience.... For our
lives will have had an end the most glorious of all that
fall to the lot of man; it is therefore more fitting to do us
honour than to lament us."</p>

<h2><span class="gesperrt">CHAPTER II</span><br />
<span class="small">LETTERS FROM THE FRONT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I SHALL now, for reasons explained in the Preface,
quote extracts from letters which Raymond wrote to
members of his family during the time he was serving
in Flanders.</p>

<p>A short note made by me the day after he first started
for the Front may serve as a preliminary statement of
fact:&mdash;
<br />
<br />
</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
<i>Mariemont, Edgbaston,<br />
16 March 1915</i><br />
</p>

<p>Raymond was recently transferred back from Edinburgh to
Great Crosby near Liverpool; and once more began life in tents
or temporary sheds.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, Monday the 15th March, one of the
subalterns was ordered to the Front; he went to a doctor, who
refused to pass him, owing to some temporary indisposition.
Raymond was then asked if he was fit: he replied, Perfectly.
So at 10 a.m. he was told to start for France that night. Accordingly
he packed up; and at 3.00 we at Mariemont received a
telegram from him asking to be met at 5 p.m., and saying he could
spend six hours at home.</p>

<p>His mother unfortunately was in London, and for many
hours was inaccessible. At last some of the telegrams reached
her, at 7 p.m., and she came by the first available (slow) train
from Paddington, getting here at 11.</p>

<p>Raymond took the midnight train to Euston; Alec, Lionel,
and No�l accompanying him. They would reach Euston at 3.50
a.m. and have two hours to wait, when he was to meet a Captain
[Capt. Taylor], and start from Waterloo for Southampton. The
boys intended to see him off at Waterloo, and then return home
to their war-business as quickly as they could.</p>

<p>He seems quite well; but naturally it has been rather a
strain for the family: as the same sort of thing has been for so
many other families.</p>

<p class="right">
O. J. L.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First comes a letter written on his way to the Front
after leaving Southampton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[ 16]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
<i>"Hotel Dervaux, 75 Grande Rue,<br />
Boulogne-s/Mer,<br />
Wednesday, 24 March 1915, 11.30 a.m.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"Following on my recent despatch, I have the honour
to report that we have got stuck here on our way to the
Front. Not stuck exactly, but they have shunted us into
a siding which we reached about 8 a.m., and we are free
until 2.30 p.m. when we have to telephone for further orders
to find out where we are to join our train. I don't know
whether this is the regular way to the Front from Rouen.
I don't think it is, I fancy the more direct way must be
reserved for urgent supplies and wounded.</p>

<p>"My servant has been invaluable <i>en route</i> and he has
caused us a great deal of amusement. He hunted round
at the goods station at Rouen (whence we started) and
found a large circular tin. He pierced this all over to form
a brazier and attached a wire handle. As soon as we got
going he lit this, having filled it with coal purloined from
somewhere, and when we stopped by the wayside about 10
or 11 p.m. he supplied my compartment (four officers) with
fine hot tea. He had previously purchased some condensed
milk. He also saw to it that a large share of the rations,
provided by the authorities before we left, fell to our
share, and looked after us and our baggage in the most
splendid way.</p>

<p>"He insists on treating the train as a tram. As soon
as it slows down to four miles an hour, he is down on the
permanent way gathering firewood or visiting some railway
hut in search of plunder. He rides with a number of
other servants in the baggage waggon, and as they had no
light he nipped out at a small station and stole one of the
railway men's lamps. However, there was a good deal of
fuss, and the owner came and indignantly recovered it.</p>

<p>"As soon as we stop anywhere, he lowers out of his van
the glowing brazier. He keeps it burning in the van! I
wonder the railway authorities don't object. If they do, of
course he pretends not to understand any French.</p>

<p>"He often gets left behind on the line, and has to
scramble into our carriage, where he regales us with his
life history until the next stop, when he returns to his own
van.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[ 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Altogether he is a very rough customer and wants a
lot of watching&mdash;all the same he makes an excellent servant."

<h3><span class="smcap">Letters from the Front in Flanders</span></h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
"<i>Friday, 26 March 1915</i><br />
</p>

<p>"I arrived here yesterday about 5 p.m., and found the
Battalion resting from the trenches. We all return there
on Sunday evening.</p>

<p>"I got a splendid reception from my friends here, and
they have managed to get me into an excellent Company,
all the officers of which are my friends. This place is
very muddy, but better than it was, I understand. We
are in tents."
<br />
<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
"<i>Saturday, 27 March 1915, 4.30 p.m.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"We moved from our camp into billets last night and
are now in a farm-house. The natives still live here, and
we (five officers) have a room to ourselves, and our five
servants and our cook live and cook for us in the kitchen.
The men of our Company are quartered in neighbouring
farm buildings, and other Companies farther down the road.
We are within a mile of a village and about three or
four miles to the southward of a fair-sized and well-known
town. The weather is steadily improving and the mud is
drying up&mdash;though I haven't seen what the trenches are
like yet....</p>

<p>"I am now permanently attached to C Company and am
devoutly thankful. Captain T. is in command and the
subalterns are Laws, Fletcher, and Thomas, all old friends
of mine. F. was the man whose room I shared at Edinburgh
and over whose bed I fixed the picture....</p>

<p>"We went on a 'fatigue' job to-day&mdash;just our Company&mdash;and
were wrongly directed and so went too far
and got right in view of the enemy's big guns. However,
we cleared out very quickly when we discovered our error,
and had got back on to the main road again when a
couple of shells burst apparently fairly near where we had
been. There were a couple of hostile aeroplanes about
too.... Thank you very much for your letter wondering
where I am. 'Very pressing are the Germans,' a buried
city."</p>

<p>[This of course privately signified to the family that
he was at Ypres.]</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right"><i>"1 April 1915, 1.15 p.m.</i>
</p>

<p>"We dug trenches by night on Monday and Wednesday,
and although we were only about 300 to 500 yards from
the enemy we had a most peaceful time, only a very few
stray bullets whistling over from time to time."
<br />
<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
"<i>Saturday, 3 April 1915, 7 p.m.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"I am having quite a nice time in the trenches. I am
writing this in my dug-out by candle-light; this afternoon
I had a welcome shave. Shaving and washing is usually
dispensed with during our spell of duty (even by the
Colonel), but if I left it six days I should burst my razor
I think. I have got my little 'Primus' with me and it is
very useful indeed as a standby, although we do all our
main cooking on a charcoal brazier....</p>

<p>"I will look out for the great sunrise to-morrow morning
and am wishing you all a jolly good Easter: I shan't
have at all a bad one. It is very like Robinson Crusoe&mdash;we
treasure up our water supply most carefully (it is
brought up in stone jars), and we have excellent meals off
limited and simple rations, by the exercise of a little native
cunning on the part of our servants, especially mine."

<p class="right">
"<i>Bank Holiday, 5 April 1915, 4.30 p.m.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"The trenches are only approached and relieved at night-time,
and even here we are not allowed to stir from the
house by day on any pretext whatever, and no fires are
allowed on account of the smoke. (Fires are started within
doors when darkness falls and we have a hot meal then
and again in the early morning&mdash;that is the rule&mdash;however,
we do get a fire in the day by using charcoal only
and lighting up from a candle to one piece and from that
one piece to the rest, by blowing; also I have my Primus
stove.) ... We are still within rifle-fire range here, but
of course it is all unaimed fire from the intermittent conflict
going on at the firing line....</p>

<p>"I have a straw bed covered with my tarpaulin sheet&mdash;(it
is useful although I have also the regular military
rubber ground sheet as well)&mdash;and my invaluable air-pillow.
I am of course travelling light and have to carry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[ 19]</a></span>
everything in my 'pack' until I get back to my valise
and 'rest billets,' so I sleep in my clothes. Simply take
off my boots and puttees, put my feet in a nice clean sack,
take off my coat and cover myself up with my British
Warm coat (put on sideways so as to use its great width
to the full). Like this I sleep like a top and am absolutely
comfortable."</p>

<p>"I have been making up an Acrostic for you all to guess&mdash;here
it is:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lights.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">My first is speechless, and a bell</span><br />

<p>"My room-mate has changed for to-night, and I have
got Wyatt, who has just come in covered in mud, after
four days in the trenches. He is machine-gun officer, and
works very hard. I am so glad to have him.</p>

<p>"By the way the support-trenches aren't half bad. I
didn't want to leave them, but it's all right here too."
<br />
<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
"<i>Thursday, 8 April 1915</i><br />
</p>

<p>"Here I am back again in 'Rest Billets,' for six days'
rest. When I set off for the six days' duty I was ardently
looking forward to this moment, but there is not much
difference; here we 'pig' it pretty comfortably in a house,
and there we 'pig' it almost as comfortably in a 'dug-out.'
There we are exposed to rifle fire, nearly all unaimed,
and here we are exposed to shell fire&mdash;aimed, but
from about five miles away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[ 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"On the whole this is the better, because there is more
room to move about, more freedom for exercise, and there
is less mud. But you will understand how much conditions
in the trenches have improved if comparison is possible
at all.</p>

<p>"My platoon (No. 11) has been very fortunate; we have
had no casualties at all in the last six days. The nearest
thing to one was yesterday when we were in the firing
trench, and a man got a bullet through his cap quite close
to his head. He was peeping over the top, a thing they
are all told not to do in the daytime. The trenches at our
point are about a hundred yards apart, and it is really safe
to look over if you don't do it too often, but it is unnecessary,
as we had a periscope and a few loopholes....</p>

<p>"I am awfully grateful for all the things that have
been sent, and are being sent.... I will attach a list of
wants at the end of this letter. I am very insatiable (that's
not quite the word I wanted), but I am going on the principle
that you and the rest of the family are only waiting
to gratify my every whim! So, if I think of a thing I ask
for it....</p>

<p>"By the way we have changed our billets here. Our
last ones have been shelled while we were away&mdash;a prodigious
hole through the roof wrecking the kitchen, but
not touching our little room at the back. However, it is
not safe enough for habitation and the natives even have
left!</p>

<p>"Things are awfully quiet here. We thought at first
that it was 'fishy' and something was preparing, but I don't
think so now. It is possibly the principle of 'live and let
live.' In the trenches if we don't stir them up with shots
they leave us pretty well alone. Of course we are ready
for anything all the same.</p>

<p>"Yes, we see the daily papers here as often as we want
to (the day's before). Personally, and I think my view
is shared by all the other officers, I would rather read a
romance, or anything not connected with this war, than
a daily paper....</p>

<p>"Was the Easter sunrise a success? It wasn't here.
Cloudy and dull was how I should describe it. Fair to
fine generally, some rain (the latter not to be taken in the
American sense).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[ 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder if you got my Acrostic [see previous letter]
and whether anybody guessed it; it was meant to be very
easy, but perhaps acrostics are no longer the fashion and
are somewhat boring. I always think they are more fun
to make than to undo. The solution is a household word
here, because it is only a half-mile or so away, and provides
most things."</p>

<p>"We are all right here except for the shells. When
I arrived I found every one suffering from nerves and
unwilling to talk about shells at all. And now I understand
why. The other day a shrapnel burst near our billet
and a piece of the case caught one of our servants (Mr.
Laws's) on the leg and hand. He lost the fingers of his
right hand, and I have been trying to forget the mess it
made of his right leg&mdash;ever since. He will have had it
amputated by now.</p>

<p>"They make you feel awfully shaky, and when one
comes over it is surprising the pace at which every one gets
down into any ditch or hole near.</p>

<p>"One large shell landed right on the field where the
men were playing football on Sunday evening. They all
fell flat, and all, I'm thankful to say, escaped injury, though
a few were within a yard or so of the hole. The other
subalterns of the Company and I were (<i>mirabile dictu</i>) in
church at the time.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you can get hold of some morphia tablets
[for wounded men]. I think injection is too complicated,
but I understand there are tablets that can merely be placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[ 22]</a></span>
in the mouth to relieve pain. They might prove very useful
in the trenches, because if a man is hit in the morning he
will usually have to wait till dark to be removed.</p>

"<i>Sunday, 18 April 1915</i><br />
</p>

<p>"I came out of the trenches on Friday night. It was
raining, so the surface of the ground was very slippery;
and it was the darkest night I can remember. There was
a good deal of 'liveliness' too, shots were flying around
more than usual. There were about a hundred of us in our
party, two platoons (Fletcher's and mine) which had been
in the fire trenches, though I was only with them for one
day, Thursday night till Friday night. Captain Taylor was
in front, then Fletcher's platoon, then Fletcher, then my
platoon, then me bringing up the rear. We always travel
in single file, because there are so many obstacles to negotiate&mdash;plank
bridges and 'Johnson' holes being the chief.</p>

<p>"Picture us then shuffling our way across the fields
behind the trenches at about one mile an hour&mdash;with frequent
stops while those in front negotiate some obstacle
(during these stops we crouch down to try and miss most
of the bullets!). Every few minutes a 'Very' light will
go up and then the whole line 'freezes' and remains absolutely
stationary in its tracks till the light is over. A
'Very' light is an 'asteroid.' (No�l will explain that.) It
is fired either by means of a rocket (in the German case)
or of a special pistol called a 'Very' pistol after the inventor
(in our case). The light is not of magnesium
brightness, but is just a bright star light with a little parachute
attached, so that it falls slowly through the air.
The light lasts about five seconds. These things are being
shot up at short intervals all night long. Sometimes
dozens are in the air together, especially if an attack
is on.</p>

<p>"Well, to go back to Friday night:&mdash;it took us a very
long time to get back, and at one point it was hard to believe
that they hadn't seen us. Lights went up and almost
a volley whistled over us. We all got right down and
waited for a bit. Really we were much too far off for
them to see us, but we were on rather an exposed bit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[ 23]</a></span>
ground, and they very likely fix a few rifles on to that part
in the daytime and 'poop' them off at night. That is a
favourite plan of theirs, and works very well.</p>

<p>"We did get here in the end, and had no casualties,
though we had had one just before leaving the trench.
A man called Raymond (in my platoon) got shot through
the left forearm. He was firing over the parapet and
had been sniping snipers (firing at their flashes). Rather
a nasty wound through an artery. They applied a tourniquet
and managed to stop the bleeding, but he was so
weak from loss of blood he had to be carried back on a
stretcher.</p>

<p>"I had noticed this man before, partly on account of
his name. Last time I was in the fire trenches (about ten
days ago) I was dozing in my dug-out one evening and the
Sergeant-Major was in his, next door. Suddenly he calls
out 'Raymond!' I started. Then he calls again 'Raymond!
Come here!' I shouted out 'Hallo! What's the matter?'
But then I heard the other Raymond answering, so I guessed
how it was....</p>

<p>"While at tea in the next room the post came and brought
me your letter and one from Alec. Isn't it perfectly marvellous?
You were surprised at the speed of my last letter.
But how about yours? The postmark is 2.30 p.m. on the
16th at Birmingham, and here it is in my hands at 4 p.m. on
the 18th!</p>

<p>"I was telling you about the difficulties of going to and
fro between here and the trenches, but you will understand
it is not always like that. If there is a moon, or even if
there is a clear sky so that we can get the benefit of the
starlight (which is considerable and much more than I
thought), matters are much improved, because if you can
still see the man in front, when he is, say, 5 yards in front
of you, and can also see the holes instead of finding them
with your person, all that 'waiting for the "tail" to close up'
is done away with....</p>

<p>"Last night Laws, Thomas, and myself each took a
party of about forty-five down separately, leaving the remainder
guarding the various billets. Then when we returned
Fletcher took the rest down.</p>

<p>"It was a glorious night, starry, with a very young and
inexperienced moon, and quite dry and warm. I would not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[ 24]</a></span>
have minded going down again except that I would rather
go to bed, which I did.</p>

<p>"Do you know that joke in <i>Punch</i> where the Aunt says:
'Send me a postcard when you are safely in the trenches!'?
Well, there is a great deal of truth in that&mdash;one feels quite
safe when one reaches the friendly shelter of the trench,
though of course the approaches aren't really very dangerous.
One is 'thrilled' by the whistle of the bullets near you.
That describes the feeling best, I think&mdash;it is a kind of
excitement."

<p>"I have received a most grand periscope packed, with
spare mirrors, in a canvas haversack. It is a glorious one
and I am quite keen to use it, thank you very much indeed
for it. Thank you also for two sets of ear defenders
which I am going to test when firing off a 'Very' light.
A 'parachuted' star is fired from a brass pistol with a
bore of about 1 inch and a barrel of about 6 inches. The
report is very deafening, I believe&mdash;though I haven't fired
one yet.</p>

<p>"The star, by the way, though it lights up the country
for some distance, is not too bright to look at.</p>

<p>"I have just remembered something I wanted to tell you,
so I will put it in here.</p>

<p>"When walking to and from the trenches in the darkness,
I find it is a great help to study the stars (not for purposes
of direction). I know very little about them, and
I saw a very useful plan in, I think, the <i>Daily News</i> of
3 April, called 'The Night Sky in April.' It was just
a circle with the chief planets and stars shown and
labelled. The periphery of the circle represented the
horizon.</p>

<p>"If you know of such a plan that is quite easily obtainable
I should be glad to have one. The simpler the thing
the better.</p>

<p>"The books you had sent me, which were passed on to
me by Professor Leith, are much appreciated. They circulate
among officers of this Company like a library. At

<p>"I wish you could see me now. I am having a little
holiday in Belgium. At the moment I am sitting in the
shade of a large tree, leaning against its trunk, writing to
you. The sun is pouring down and I have been sitting in
it lying on a fallen tree, but it makes me feel lazy, so I
came here to write (in the shade).</p>

<p>"Before me, across a moat, is the ch�teau&mdash;ruined now,
but not by old age. It is quite a handsome building, two
storeys high. It is built of brick with a slate roof; the
bricks are colour-washed yellow with a white band 18 inches
deep under the roof; there are two towers with pointed
roofs that stand to the front of the house, projecting
slightly from it, forming bay windows. These towers, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[ 26]</a></span>
the roof down to the ground, are red brick, as are the fronts
of the dormer windows in the main building.</p>

<p>"The larger and taller tower is octagonal and stands
in the middle of the front, the smaller one is square and
stands on the right corner. On each side of the main building
are flanking buildings consisting on this (left) side of
a brick-built palm-house and beyond that again a glass-covered
conservatory. The other flank has a conservatory
also, but I have not explored as far as that. The front of
the building is about 70 to 80 yards long.</p>

It is reached by a drawbridge over the moat. The house

sketch it, so I have given you a rough elevation from the

<blockquote>
<p>"The place is in an awful mess. In some parts it is
difficult to tell how the original building went. One can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[ 27]</a></span>
see into several of the rooms; the outer wall has fallen
away, exposing about three rooms and an attic. In one
room the floor has dropped at one corner to some 8 feet
below its proper level, and a bed is just above poised on the
edge of the room, almost falling out where the room is
sectioned.</p>

<p>"There is no glass in any of the green-houses&mdash;it is all
on the floor. The palm-house is full of green tubs with
plants in them, mostly overturned.</p>

<p>"In the garden the trees are blossoming, some of the
fruit trees are covered with white blossom; but many,
even of these, are lying flat and blossoming in the moat.
The drive runs down to the road on the south side in an
absolutely straight line, flanked by tall trees. But many of
these are down too. I was lying on one just now. The
garden is in good order, though getting a little out of hand.
There is a small plantation of gooseberry bushes that looks
very healthy. Shell holes are all about, however.</p>

<p>"The house, although it is not on an eminence, commands
a good view to the southward and has a fine view
of the German lines, which are slightly raised just here.
The enemy evidently suspected this ch�teau was used as an
observation post, as indeed it may have been.</p>

<p>"We came out of the trenches on Wednesday night into
Reserve Billets, and I was placed with No. 9 platoon
(instead of my own) in a little house not far from this
ch�teau. We are not allowed to leave it by day, or rather
we are not allowed to show ourselves on the south side of
it, as it might draw shell-fire on to it. But I managed to
sneak away to the north under cover of a hedge without
any risk of being seen.</p>

<p>"After being relieved in the trenches on Wednesday,
and marching back and having a meal with the other officers
of C Company in the Reserve Billets (a brewery),
it was one o'clock before I got to bed in our little house.
And we had to 'stand to arms' in the morning for an hour
while dawn was breaking (we always do, and at dusk too).
So after this I went to sleep till 2 p.m. I sleep in an outhouse
with no door, on straw laid on a brick floor. My
ground-sheet on the straw, my coat over me, my feet in a
sack and an air-cushion under my head, and I can sleep
as peacefully as at home. The place is swarming with rats
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[ 28]</a></span>
and mice, you can hear them directly you lie still. They
go 'plop, plop, plop,' on the straw overhead, as if they
were obliged to take long strides owing to their feet sinking
into the straw. Immediately over my head, I should judge,
there is a family of young rats by the noise. Occasionally
they have a stampede and a lot of dust comes down on
my face.</p>

<p>"But one gets used to this, and muttering 'Nom d'un
chien!' one turns the other cheek. By the way, they say
these rats 'stand to' at dawn, just as we do.</p>

<p>"I am terrified of a rat running over my face, but my
servant sleeps with me, so I console myself that the chances
are just even that they won't choose me. I wish he wouldn't
snore though&mdash;he's lowering the odds.</p>

<p>"Last night we had to turn out for fatigue parties. I
took a party down to one of the fire trenches with 'knife
rests.' These are sections of barbed wire entanglement.
They are made by fixing cross-pieces on the ends of a long
pole. The tips of these cross-pieces are joined together
with barbed wire laid parallel to the centre pole. Then
the whole is wound with more barbed wire laid on spirally,
thus: [a sketch]</p>

<p>These are slung out in front of the trenches and fixed together.
They are now fixed also to the trench, because
the Germans used to harpoon them and draw them over to
their own side!</p>

<p>"Well, we set off about 11 p.m. and took twenty-two of
these down. We didn't exactly bless the full moon&mdash;although
it showed us the holes and obstructions in the way.
Still, we had no casualties and made good time. We got
back about midnight. So I only slept till 12.30 this morning!
Of course I had to get up for an hour at dawn. I used
the time to brew myself some cocoa. I am getting an expert
cook, and can make that 'Bivouac' cocoa taste like the very
finest chocolate....</p>

<p>"Just before going into the trenches I received another
of those splendid parcels of cabbage and apples. The apples
are simply splendid. The cabbage is good, but I never
cared very much for it&mdash;it is medicinal in this case. However,
it is great to have such a fine supply of green stuff
instead of none at all. The Mess does appreciate it.</p>

<p>"I have been supplying our Mess (C Company) with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[ 29]</a></span>
butter. And the supply sent up to now has just effected
this with none to spare. But I don't know whether you
want to do this, and that is why I suggested cutting down
the supply. I don't want you to think any of it has been
wasted though&mdash;it hasn't, and is splendid stuff....</p>

<p>"In the trenches one is not always doing nothing. These
last three days in I have been up all night. I had a working
party in two shifts working all night and all three nights,
digging communication trenches. I used to go to bed about
4.20 a.m. and sleep till lunch-time, and perhaps lie down
again for a bit in the afternoon. That is why my letters
have not been so frequent.</p>

<p>"It is extraordinary that what is wanted at the moment
is not so much a soldier as a civil engineer. There
are trenches to be laid out and dug, and the drainage of
them to be thought out and carried through. Often the
sides have to be 'riveted' or staked, and a flooring of
boards put in, supported on small piles.</p>

<p>"Then there is the water-supply, where one exists. I
have had great fun arranging a 'source' in my trench
(the support trench that I have been in these last three
days and that I have been in often before). A little stream,
quite clear and drinkable after boiling, runs out at one
place (at about 1 pint a minute!) and makes a muddy
mess of the trenches near. By damming it up and putting
a water-bottle with the bottom knocked in on top of the
dam, the water runs in a little stream from the mouth of
the bottle. It falls into a hole large enough to receive a
stone water-jar, and then runs away down a deep trough
cut beside the trench. Farther down it is again dammed
up to form a small basin which the men use for washing; and
it finally escapes into a kind of marshy pond in rear of the
trenches.</p>

<p>"I quite enjoyed this job, and there are many like it;
plank bridges to be put up, seats and steps to be cut, etc.
One officer put half a dozen of his men on to making a
folding bed! But it was not for himself, but for his Captain,
who has meningitis and can't sleep. The men enjoy
these jobs too; it is much better than doing nothing.</p>

<p>"I will creep back to my quarters now and make myself
some tea on my 'Primus' (no fires are allowed).</p>

<p>"A cuckoo has been singing on a tree near me&mdash;in full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[ 30]</a></span>
view. (It left hurriedly when one of our guns went off
close behind the ch�teau.) The first time I have ever seen
one, I think. It is amazing how tame the animals get.
They have so much ground to themselves in the daytime&mdash;the
rats especially; they flourish freely in the space between
the trenches.</p>

<p>"Things are fairly quiet and easy here just now."

<p>[In one of his letters to me <a href="#Page_24">(22 April 1915)</a>, he said he had

star maps or something in order to increase his knowledge of
them. Accordingly, I sent him a planisphere which I happened
to have&mdash;an ingenious cardboard arrangement which can be

is too short. If it were longer the light would be thrown
farther, which would be much better. As it is, it falls
between us and the Germans.</p>

<p>"The German lights, which I now learn are fired from
a kind of mortar and not by a rocket as I thought, are
much better than ours; they give a better and steadier,
fatter light, and they are thrown well behind our trenches.
However, ours are much better, and theirs are worse than
they used to be....</p>

on some days I have smelled distinct traces coming down
wind from the north. I should say it was chlorine rather
than SO<sub>2</sub> that I smelled. I don't know whether the ammonia
preventive would be better than the soda one. In any
case, the great thing is that one is provided. The soda
method is the one in use, I believe, in the chlorine works at

and with us. They sent over some 'Johnsons,' but these
all went too far; we were screened by a reservoir embankment.
However, we had to pass through a ruined
village and they knew it, so they put shrapnel over it.
Still we were unaffected. But when we came out into
the open on the far side, we caught it properly. Shell
after shell came over and burst above us, and when I and
about three men behind me had just turned a corner one
burst above, in exactly the spot I should have wished it
to if I had been the enemy. I looked up and saw the air
full of flying pieces, some large and some small. These
spattered down all round us. I was untouched, but my
servant, who was immediately behind me, was hit on the
knee, but only wounded slightly. He was rather scared.
I led him back round the corner again and put him in a
ditch. The rest of the platoon got in too, while I was
doing this. I thought that was the best thing they could
do until the shelling ceased, but Fletcher shouted that we
must get on, whatever happened.</p>

<p>"So I called the men out again, and, leaving a man
with the wounded, we set off. I don't believe it was
right, but we just walked along. It felt rather awful.
(When one is <i>retiring</i> it is important not to let the men
'double,' as they get out of hand; but in this case we were
advancing, so I think we might have done so.) I felt very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[ 33]</a></span>
much protected. It was really a miracle that we weren't
nearly all 'wiped out.' The shrapnel seemed very poor
stuff. As it was, we had one man killed and about five or
six injured, all more or less slightly.</p>

<p>"We moved up into a support trench that same evening,
and after a couple of days we moved a few yards
farther to these trenches, which are also support trenches.
Things are very quiet, and I am enjoying myself very
much. If it wasn't for the unpleasant sights one is liable
to see, war would be a most interesting and pleasant
affair.</p>

<p>"My friends the other officers of C Company have
given me the honorary position of 'O.C. Works.' One is
always 'O.C. something or other' out here&mdash;all but the
Colonel, he is 'C.O.' Orders for the day read: "O.C.
Companies will do so-and-so.' Then there are O.C. Details,
O.C. Reinforcements, etc. 'O.C.' of course stands
for 'officer commanding.' Well, I am 'O.C. Works,' and
have a fine time. I just do any job I fancy, giving
preference to trench improvement. It is fine to
have at one's disposal a large squad of men with shovels
(or without). They fill sandbags and carry them, they carry
timber and saw it, and in short do anything that
is required. One can accomplish something under these
conditions."

<h3>NOTE BY O. J. L.</h3>

<p>The dream referred to, near the beginning of this long letter
to his mother, Mr. J. Arthur Hill remembers that I told him of,
in a letter dated 7 May 1915, which he has now returned; and
I reproduce it here:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">"To J. A. H.</p>
<p class="right">
"<i>7 May 1915</i><br />
</p>

<p>"I do not reckon that I often have conscious intuitions; and
when I have had vivid dreams they have not meant anything,
though once or twice I have recorded them because I have
them seldom. I happen, however, to have had an intuition this
morning, before I was more than half awake, which, though
not specially vivid, perhaps I had better record, namely, that
an attack was going on at the present moment, that my son
was in it, but that 'they' were taking care of him. I had this
clearly in mind before seeing the morning papers; and indeed
I do not know that there is anything in the morning papers
suggesting it, since of course their news is comparatively old.
One might have surmised, however, that there would be a
struggle for Hill 60, and I know that my son is not far off
Ypres. (By the way, I have been told that the Flemish
Belgians really do call it 'Wipers'; it does not sound likely,
and it needs confirmation. I know of course that our troops
are said to call it so, which is natural enough.) O. J. L."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[ 35]</a></span></p>

<p>I now (August 1916) notice for the first time that the coincidence
in time between dream and fact is rather good, especially
as it was the only dream or 'impression' that I remember having
during the war. Practically I do not dream.</p>

<p>But as this incident raises the question of possible presentiment
I must deny that we had any serious presentiment about
Raymond. My wife tells me that her anxiety about Raymond,
though always present, was hardly keen, as she had an idea
that he would be protected. She wrote to a friend on 22 March
1915:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"... I ought to get him back safe. I have a hole in my
heart and shall have till he comes back. I only saw him
for the inside of an hour before he left, as I was away
when he came home for six hours...."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the same time I must admit that on the morning of
15 September 1915 (the day after Raymond's death, which we
did not know of till the 17th) I was in an exceptional state of
depression; and though a special game, to which I had been
looking forward, on the No. 1 Course at Gullane had been arranged
with Rowland Waterhouse, I could not play a bit. Not ordinary
bad play, but total incompetence; so much so that after seven
holes we gave up the game, and returned to the hotel. To make
sure of the date, I wrote to Rowland Waterhouse, asking him
when that abortive match occurred, since I knew that it was his
last day at Gullane. He replies:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Violet and I left Gullane for Musselburgh on Wednesday,
15 September. Our final match ended that morning on the
eighth tee" [which that year was on the reservoir hill].</p>

<p>One more dream I may as well now mention:&mdash;</p>

<p>After the family had returned home from Scotland and
elsewhere, near the end of September 1915, and begun to settle
down, Alec, who had felt Raymond's death exceedingly, told me
that the night before he heard the news&mdash;or rather the early
morning of the same day, 17 September&mdash;he had had an extraordinarily
painful and vivid dream, quite an exceptional occurrence
for him, and one of which he had spoken to a manageress in the
hotel near Swansea where he was staying, describing it as the
worst he had ever had in his life. He did not know that it had
any significance, and neither do I, as the dream, though rather
ghastly, was not about Raymond or anyone in particular; but
it seemed an odd coincidence that the ill news should be, so to
speak, on the way, at the time of a quite exceptional and painful
impression. The person to whom he told the dream handed
him the telegram a few hours later. He has written the dream
down, but it need not be reproduced.</p>

<p>No real provision is involved in any of this, unless it be that
of an hour or two in my own impression, in May; but for general
remarks on the question of the possibility of prevision <a href="#Page_312">Chapter V</a>
in Part III may be referred to.

"<i>Sunday, 5.40 p.m., 16 May 1915</i><br />
</p>

<p>"We had a very fine piece of news yesterday. Over
three weeks ago we were called out one night and were
urgently required to dig a certain new trench behind our
lines. The men worked splendidly and got the job done
in a very short time (working of course in complete darkness).
The next day the Brigadier-General inspected the
trench and sent in a complimentary message about it to
our Colonel. The day after he complimented us again&mdash;for
the same piece of work! Well, we have had several such
jobs to do, and just recently we have been to Hill 60, where
the bulk of our work was deepening the trenches and improving
the parapets. We were lent for this purpose to
another Division (the Division that is at the moment occupying
that area), and were away from here exactly a
week. We got a splendid testimonial from the General of
this other Division, who told our Colonel he had got 'a
top-hole battalion.' Arising out of all this, we have now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[ 37]</a></span>
been selected as a 'Pioneer Battalion,' We are relieved
from all ordinary trench work for some time to come. We
simply go out at night and dig trenches or build parapets
and so forth, and have the day to ourselves. This was
arranged yesterday, and last night we went out and returned
here at 1.30 a.m. The work is more or less under
fire, but only from stray shots and nothing very serious.
Our Colonel is awfully pleased that we have done so well;
and we are all pleased with the new arrangement. One
great advantage is that we can settle down in our billets
and are not continually having to pack up everything and
move off. We can now start and make tables, chairs,
beds, a proper door for the hut, a glass window, and so
on....</p>

<p>"As to aeroplanes, when one passes overhead a whistle
is blown and every one either takes cover or stands perfectly
still. The men are forbidden to look up. Then the
whistle is blown several times when the danger is past.
I am afraid, though, these regulations are more honoured in
the breach than the observance.</p>

<p>"We had quite a nice informal service here this afternoon
sitting in a field. The chaplain has the rank of Major
and has been out here seven months.</p>

<p>"Yesterday the Captain, Fletcher, and myself went for
a ride on horses. We went about five miles out, stopped
for about twenty minutes at a little inn (the last in Belgium
on that particular road), and then came back again.
The country was perfectly lovely, though I did not appreciate
it as much as I otherwise would have done, as I had
a trooper's saddle and the Captain would trot. I got
most awfully sore going out, and thought I should never
be able to get back. However, I discovered a method at
last, and that was to go at a full gallop. So I alternately
went at a walk and 'hell for leather,' and got back in comparative
comfort. I thoroughly enjoyed it; it was very
bad for the horse, I am afraid, on the stone setts (<i>pav�</i>),
but sometimes I could get him on to the softer bits at the
side. I was terribly afraid some one would think the horse
was running away with me and 'block' him, so I had to look
as pleased as possible. And really I <i>was</i> pleased, it was
such a blessed relief after that awful trotting. I trotted
along in rear of the other two until I could stand it no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[ 38]</a></span>
longer, and then I encouraged my nag and hit him until
he broke into a canter, and then I roared past the others,
who cursed like anything because theirs wanted to gallop
too. My horse's cantor changed imperceptibly into a full
gallop, and I 'got down to it' and felt like a jockey. After
about half a mile I would walk until the others came up
and passed me, and then I would go off again. All the
same, I am very sore.</p>

<p>"Good-bye for the present; it is lovely hot weather
and we are all well&mdash;fit&mdash;and happy."

<p>"They arrived by the first post after we had returned

the day, and, when we left, the trenches were vastly improved

new ones. We are now kept for this sort of job only, and
we go out working at nights and sleep by day.</p>

<p>"I must explain to you about 'standing to.' A proportion
of the men are always awake in the trenches to
guard against surprises, for as the most likely times for an
attack are at dawn and at dusk, everybody has to be
awake and ready then. Of course it does interfere with
your sleep, and you do not get very much as a rule in the
trenches, but that is why you are not there for more than
about three days at a time. In the 'supports' you 'stand to'
so as to be ready to reinforce the front line quickly in case
of an attack. Out in 'Rest Billets,' I am glad to say, it is
no longer necessary.</p>

but various headquarter staffs seem to come in turn
and occupy two of the other ground floor rooms occasionally.</p>

<p>"We have been out two nights digging on the opposite
side of the town, but we have not been ordered out to-night,
so far.</p>

<p>"I notice I have now been gazetted back to 15 August,
the same as most of my contemporaries.</p>

<p>"There has been a suggestion made that I should take
a course of machine-gun instruction in order that I
might act as understudy to our present Machine-Gun
Officer (M.G.O.) who is Roscoe, and is the successor to
Wyatt. I agreed, but it may have 'fallen through' owing
to the move. If it comes off I shall go for a fortnight's
course to a place which I will call No. 3 [probably St.
Omer.]</p>

<p>"I got a letter from you to-day about 5 p.m. I was
so glad.</p>

<p>"No, I am not making things out better than they really
are. I like to write mostly about the pleasant parts, of
course. We have our unpleasant moments, shelling and so
on, but no very bad times as yet. Being on tenterhooks is
quite the worst part.</p>

<p>"As regards Fletcher being worse than us, of course
he came out much earlier. He left Edinburgh for the
Front on 4 January, and Laws left on 31 December. He
has had some awful times and the winter campaign, and
in any case the length of time one is exposed to the mental
strain and worry makes a difference. I do my best to
keep cheerful and happy all the time&mdash;I don't believe in
meeting trouble half-way. If there was some indication of
the termination of the war it would help matters&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[ 43]</a></span>
unending vista is apt to be rather disheartening at times.
I am very glad Italy is in&mdash;at last.</p>

<p>"By the way, Fletcher has not been sent to England
(Blighty) after all. He is at Versailles, in the No. 4
General Hospital there, having a nice time if he can enjoy
it. This hospital is the Trianon Palace. The Captain had
a letter from him in which he sent his love to 'Maurice' and
'his lordship' (that's Thomas)."

<p>"Our interpreter is a Belgian, and is a very nice man.
He does our shopping for us in the town, which is ten miles
or so away, and (as now arranged) he makes the journey
twice a week. It is very funny to hear him talk, he picks
up the soldiers' idioms and uses them in the wrong places.
One he is very fond of is the expression 'Every time'! He
puts such a funny emphasis on it.</p>

<p>"The last member of our Mess is a man who has just
come out and has not long had his commission. He used
to be Regimental Sergeant-Major to our 1st Battalion and
has had about twenty-six years' service, so he knows his
job.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, however, his arrival is not an unmixed
blessing. The Captain is seized with enthusiasm and wants
to make our Company the finest Company in the Battalion.
The result is that we have now nothing but parades and
much less rest than before. When we were turned into
a pioneer battalion the Colonel told the men that they would
go digging at night and would do nothing else except for
rifle inspection. Now, however, we have in addition an
hour's drill of various sorts in the morning and a lecture
to N.C.O.s in the afternoon, at which all subalterns
have to attend and take notes. On the day following a
rest night we have to be up about seven o'clock, and be
on parade while the men do half an hour's physical exercise
before breakfast. Then we have an hour and a half's
drill afterwards and the lecture. And these parades seem
to be growing. I am afraid they will wear us all out and
the men as well. Thomas feels it most and is very worried&mdash;although
he is Senior Subaltern in the Company he is
left right out of things. I am afraid of his going like
Laws and Fletcher did. Some 'rankers' are very good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[ 44]</a></span>
fellows. They bring tremendous experience with them,
but, on the other hand, we bring something too, and
when they ride the high horse they can be very unbearable....</p>

<p>"I got a supply of paraffin to-day; D Company has
bought a huge barrel of it, and I sent over a petrol tin
for some. They gave me nearly two gallons and asked
if I could let them have a window in exchange! I hunted
round and found quite a good loose one and sent it across
with my compliments. The reason they have bought up
so much paraffin is because their Captain has presented
pocket Primuses to his men. Each section of twelve men
has one between them with one man in charge of it. It
is a killing sight to see their Company sitting in a field and
drumming up!</p>

<p>"The Belgian cooking stove is rather a curious thing.
It is of the same design in every house apparently. It
consists of a metal urn to hold the fire; this has a removable
lid for which you can substitute a kettle or pan which
just fits the round opening. The urn stands about 3 feet
from the wall and has a flat-shaped iron chimney leading
into the main chimney. This iron chimney can be used
for heating pots or for warming plates. The base of the
urn is an ash collector. You will see that there is no oven;
this is built separately and is a brick affair with a separate
fire to it. [Sketch.]"

<p>"I am all right again to-day; you mustn't pay any attention
to my grumbles, it just depends what I feel like; and
I am going to stir things up about these parades. We
had a fine time last night&mdash;very exciting. We went through
the heart of the city and it is still very much on fire. The
enemy keeps sending an occasional shell into it to keep it
going. Just on the far side is a graveyard, and this has
been 'crumped' out of existence nearly! It is an unpleasant
place to pass now.</p>

<p>"The town is almost unbelievable. I don't think anyone
would credit that they could do so much damage and
not leave a single house untouched, without entering the
place at all. [Ypres again, probably.]</p>

<p>"Our digging last night was near a small road much used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[ 45]</a></span>
by transport (which is very audible at night). As the
enemy can hear the rumble of the horse-drawn carts quite
plainly, they kept on sending shrapnel over, and we had
quite a warm time of it. We were quite glad to get away
again. (No one was hit while we were there.)</p>

<p>"I had such an interesting talk with the interpreter yesterday
(his rank is the equivalent of one of our Sergeant-Majors).
He was a merchant in Morocco, and
chucked up everything and came and joined the Belgian
army as a private. He fought at Namur, Antwerp, and
other places, and is most awfully keen. He was offered
the job of Interpreter to the British Army, and, thinking
he could help more by that means and also partly for
monetary considerations, he took the job. He understood
he would be fighting with us in the trenches, but they
have put him on to shopping for us! He is awfully disappointed.
He rides up when he can, and when we went
up to Hill 60 he went up with our transports and showed
them the way and helped them a lot, although shells were
falling all round. He is a most gentlemanly man; his name
is Polchet....</p>

<p>"I had a letter from Violet and another from Margaret
yesterday. I understand they have gone up to Edinburgh
now; I shall like to go up there too 'after the war.'
I believe Violet is getting <i>my</i> room ready for me in
their house. I like everything very plain, just a valise
and a little hay, and then you see if I am hungry in the
night&mdash;&mdash;....</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;I had a most interesting letter from Oliver.
His discussion of Italy's motives is fine. I like hearing
what people think of events; we are apt to get very warped

yesterday by the arrival of kippers! How splendid!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[ 46]</a></span></p>

<p>We had a grand breakfast this morning, quite like
the summer holidays again&mdash;breakfast after a bathe&mdash;with
Alec of course!...</p>

<p>"By the way, I did not present the last lot of asparagus
to the Mess&mdash;this was not because we didn't appreciate
it, but because I felt so sorry for M. Polchet (our interpreter),
and I wondered if he had any green stuff or
luxuries. So I sent it over to him. And do you know
what he has done? He has just sent me a shallow wooden
box with a thick cotton-wool pad in it. In the pad are
six hollows, and in each hollow is a ripping nectarine. Isn't
it fine of him?</p>

<p>"We have roses picked every day for the Mess-room;
it does improve it. The other evening we had a specially
nice meal. We sat round the polished table with candles
in the centre and bowls of roses round them (as a matter
of fact the bowls were old tinned-fruit tins, but what of
that). The food was very special, though I can't remember
what it was, but to crown all there was in the room just
across the passage ... a real fiddler with a real fiddle.
I really don't know how he managed to bring a fiddle out
here; he is a private in the Royal Garrison Artillery, and
plays simply beautifully. He has long hair and just a
suggestion of side whiskers, and large boots, and, but
that he would not be complimented, looks like a
Viennese.</p>

<p>"He started off by playing Grand Opera&mdash;I believe&mdash;and
he gave us the Intermezzo from 'Cavalleria Rusticana.'
Then he gave us 'Gipsy Love' and the 'Merry
Widow,' and so on. He finished up with American ragtime.
We sent him in a bottle of whisky half-way through
the performance, and the music got lighter thenceforward.
It was most amusing to notice the effect. When we looked
in later the whisky was standing on the table, and he was
walking round it with his fiddle, playing hard and apparently
serenading it!</p>

<p>"I was inoculated again on Friday evening because it
is only <i>really</i> effective for about six months, and there is
going to be a lot of enteric about, I expect. This apparently
is just the very place for it&mdash;flat low-lying country,
poor water supply, and the soil heavily manured.
So I have been feeling rather weak and feverish after it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[ 47]</a></span>
but I am better again now. I have to have it done again
ten days later&mdash;but the second time is not so bad.</p>

after the attack&mdash;I expect you saw the account in the papers&mdash;and
died about an hour later, having never recovered
consciousness.</p>

<p>"It was a most fatal night&mdash;the whole battalion was
ordered out digging to consolidate the captured positions.
We got half-way out, and then got stuck&mdash;the road being
blocked by parties of wounded. We waited on a path
alongside a hedge for over an hour, and though we could
not be seen we had a good deal of shrapnel sent over us.
To make matters worse, they put some gas shells near,
and we had to wear our helmets though the gas was not
very strong. It was exceedingly unpleasant, and we could
hardly see at all. It was while we were waiting like this
that Thomas got knocked out.</p>

<p>"We are all sorry to lose him, and I miss him very
much, but it is nothing to the trouble there will be at his
home, for he is his mother's favourite son.</p>

<p>"I have written to his mother, but I have not told her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[ 48]</a></span>
what makes us feel so mad about it&mdash;namely, that we did
no digging that night at all. When we got to the position
we were so late, and there was still such confusion there
due to the attack, that we marched back again and just got
in before daylight. We might just as well never have gone
out. Isn't it fairly sickening?</p>

<p>"The next night we went out again, and we had a very
quiet night and no casualties. The scene of the battle was
pretty bad, and I put all my spare men on to burying.</p>

<p>"Altogether we are very thankful to have a change from
'pioneering,' and get back to the trenches!</p>

<p>"Our chief trouble here is snipers. We are in a wood,
and parties going for water and so on to our headquarters
<i>will</i> walk outside the trench instead of in it, just because
the trench goes like this. [A diagram is omitted.] They
take the straight course along the side in spite of repeated
warnings. There is one point that a sniper has got marked.
He gets our men coming back as they get into the trench
just too late. We had a man hit this morning, but not
badly, and a few minutes ago I had to stop this letter and go
to a man of B Company who had got hit, and rather more
seriously, at the same spot. I have put up a large notice
there now, and hope it will prevent any more.</p>

<p>"I am sorry this is not a very cheerful letter, but we
have all been rather sad lately. I am getting over it now.
Luckily one absorbs these things very gradually; I could
not realise it at first. It was an awful blow, because, especially
since Fletcher went away (he is now at home), we
had become very friendly, and one is apt to forget that
there is always the chance of losing a friend suddenly. As
a matter of fact, Thomas is the first officer of C Company
that has been killed for seven months.</p>

<p>"When we were up in this wood before, digging (about
a fortnight ago) B Company lost Captain Salter. I dare
say you saw his name in the Roll of Honour. We were
just going to collect our spades and come in, when he was
shot through the head by a stray bullet.</p>

<p>"What a very melancholy strain I am writing in, I am
so sorry. I am quite well and fit. We have mislaid our
mess-box coming up here with all our specially selected
foods. The result is we are on short commons&mdash;great
fun. I am eating awful messes and enjoying them. Fried

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Thomas</span>,&mdash;I am very sorry to say I have
to tell you the very worst of bad news. I know what Humphrey's
loss must be to you, and I want to tell you how much
it is to all of us too. I know I have not realised it yet
myself properly. I have been in a kind of trance since last
night and I dread to wake up.</p>

<p>"He was a very fine friend to me, especially since
Fletcher went away, and I miss him frightfully. Last
night (16th to 17th) the whole Battalion went out digging.
There had been an attack by the English early the same
morning, and the enemy's guns were still very busy even
in the evening. Our road was blocked in front owing to
the moving of a lot of wounded, and while we were held up
on a little field path alongside a hedge we had several
shrapnel shells over us. To add to the horrors of the situation
they had put some gas shells over too, and we were
obliged to put on our gas helmets. While Humphrey was
standing with his helmet on in the rear of our Company
talking to the Captain of the Company behind, a shell came
over and a piece of it caught him on the head. He was
rendered unconscious, and it was evident from the first
he had no chance of recovery. He was immediately taken
a little way back to a place where there was no gas, and
here the doctor dressed his wound. He was then taken back
on a stretcher to the dressing-station. He died there about
an hour after he had been admitted, having never recovered
consciousness.</p>

<p>"If he had to die, I am thankful he was spared pain
beforehand. It made my heart ache this afternoon packing
his valise; I have given his chocolate, cigarettes, and
tobacco to the Mess, and I have wrapped up his diary and
a few loose letters and made them into a small parcel which
is in the middle of his valise.</p>

<p>"The papers and valuables which he had on him at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[ 50]</a></span>
time will be sent back through our headquarters, the other
things, such as letters, etc., in his other pockets I have left
just as they were. I hope the valise will arrive safely.</p>

<p>"He will be buried very simply, and probably due east
of Ypres about three-quarters of a mile out&mdash;near the dressing-station.
I will of course see he has a proper cross.</p>

<p>"Humphrey was splendid always when shells were bursting
near. He hated them as much as any of us, but he
just made himself appear unconcerned in order to put heart
into the troops. Three nights ago we were digging a trench
and the Germans thought our attack was coming off that
night. For nearly three-quarters of an hour they put every
kind of shell over us and some came very close. We all lay
down in the trench and waited. On looking up once I was
amazed to see a lone figure walking calmly about as if nothing
was going on at all. It may have been foolish but it was
grand."

believe it will finish up without much help from us, and our
job is really killing time. And our time is so pleasant
it doesn't need much killing out here. The days roll along&mdash;nice
sunny days too&mdash;bringing us nearer I suppose to Peace.
(One hardly dares even to write the word now, it has such
a significance.) There have been cases where the war has
driven people off their heads (this applies only, I think, to
the winter campaign), but I often think if Peace comes suddenly
that there will be many such cases.</p>

Bad times do come along occasionally, but they are by way

This last is purely mental, and the less one worries about
it the less it is, and so one can contrive to be light-hearted
and happy through it all&mdash;unless one starts to get depressed
and moody. And it is just that which has happened to
Laws and Fletcher and one or two others. They had
been out long and had seen unpleasant times and
without an occasional rest; none but the very thick can
stand it."

Two officers per bedroom and a large Mess-room; about

acrostic [St. Omer] was perfectly right, we <i>are</i> far back.
This convent is about two miles from that town.</p>

<p>"I am so pleased to be in the 'pleasant, sunny land of
France,' amid absolute peacefulness. We had a curious
journey. Last night I slept at our transport (and had a
bath!). I got up soon after six, mounted a horse just
before eight (after breakfast). My servant and my valise,
also a groom to bring my horse back, came in a limber.
And that excellent man Polchet rode all the way to <i>Divisional</i>
Headquarters with me, although it was about six
miles out of his way. We got to Headquarters at a quarter
to ten&mdash;a motor-bus was to start at ten for here. It
started at 10.30 with me, my luggage, and my servant (I
don't know why he comes last) in it. The Harborne
motor-buses in the Harborne High Street weren't in it.
We got shaken to a jelly&mdash;we were on top. We went back
about two miles to pick up some of our Division, and having
done so, we set off to pick up some of the 14th Division,
at a point carefully specified in our driver's instructions.
This was about five miles away, in our proper
direction. But when we got to the spot we discovered
they (the Division) had left it a week ago and gone to
a point quite close to where we had just picked up the
3rd Division men. I telephoned in vain; we had to go
all the way back. We found the place with difficulty (we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[ 52]</a></span>
found all our places with difficulty as we had no maps), collected
the men, and came all the way out <i>again</i>. Then we
came straight here, which was about fifteen miles at least.
We got here at 4.30 p.m.! Six hours' motorbussing! and
the bus's maximum was 25 m.p.h. at least, I should judge.
Luckily it was a glorious day, and I sat in front with the
driver and enjoyed it all....</p>

<p>"I told you leave was starting&mdash;well, it has now started.
Three of our officers have gone&mdash;and all together! They
are only getting three clear days in England&mdash;but
still!</p>

think it lasts for sixteen days&mdash;and then I am going to
apply for my leave to follow on. I wish&mdash;oh, how I
wish&mdash;I may get it; but of course many things may intervene.</p>

<p>"If it does come off I hope there will be a representative
gathering to meet me at dinner. That is, I hope
Violet will be back from Edinburgh, Lorna and Norah
from Coniston, and perhaps Oliver and his Winifred will
pay a flying visit from Cardiff. Haven't I got an enlarged

<p>"The enemy's lines round here do not appear to be
strongly held, in fact quite the reverse&mdash;that is, the front
lines. But attacks on our part don't always pay&mdash;even
so. Their method, as I understand it, is simply to lose
less men than we do. Accordingly, they leave very few
men in their front trench, but what there are have a good
supply of machine guns and are well supported by artillery.
We precede our attacks by heavy shelling, and the few men
get into well-built dug-outs until it is over, then they come
out and get to work with their machine guns on
the attacking infantry. The trench ultimately falls after
rather heavy loss on our side (especially if the wire
isn't properly cut) and the few defenders hold up their
hands. Some are made prisoners&mdash;some are not. If the
enemy want the trench very badly they try and retake
it by means of a strong counter-attack, trusting that our
men and arrangements are in sufficient confusion to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[ 53]</a></span>
prevent adequate support. That is why our attacks are so
expensive and why we aren't constantly attacking. The
alternative plan is, I think, simply to shell them heavily&mdash;in
all their lines&mdash;and leave out the actual attack in
most cases....</p>

<p>"I was so interested to hear that Alec had applied for
me to come back. It is not at all impossible, because I
have known two or three cases where officers have been
recalled&mdash;one was chief chemist (or so he said) at Brunner
Mond's. He was returning as I came out, and tried to
make one's flesh creep by his tales of war. But I don't
think it is likely to happen in my case. I only wish it
would. I should love to come home again, although I
don't feel as if I had done my bit yet&mdash;really. I haven't
been in any big scrap, and I haven't killed my man
even....</p>

room (this necessitated the Quartermaster-Sergeant moving
his bed into another room), gave me a warm bath, and
generally made me feel quite at home. They have a ripping
dug-out. Rooms half underground, 7 feet high, plenty of
ventilation, boarded floor and walls, and a wooden roof supported
on square wooden pillars and covered in earth well
sodded on top....</p>

<p>"Talking about the Major (Major Cotton), he used to
be our Adjutant at Crosby&mdash;he was Captain then. He
came out as second in command and has now got the
Battalion while our Colonel (Colonel Dudgeon) is away
sick. The latter got his C.B. in the last honours list. He
is an excellent man. Lieut. Burlton, too, got a Military
Cross. He has now been wounded twice; he was the
moving spirit of the hockey matches at Crosby in the old
days, and, when he was recalled to the Front, his mantle
fell upon me....</p>

<p>"All the officers here are from different regiments
with a very few exceptions. It is most interesting. At
meals, Way and I sit among the Cavalry, Dragoons and
Lancers, etc. They are fine chaps&mdash;the real Army officers
of which there are now all too few."</p>

<p>"Here I am getting towards the end of my little holiday,
only five more days to go. No word has reached me
from my Battalion on the subject of leave, or of anything
else for that matter....</p>

<p>"If this threatened push on Calais is real, or if the
higher commands have got 'wind up' about it, they will
very likely stop all leave, and then I shall just have to wait
until it starts again....</p>

<p>"I am sure that the fact of our nation being 'down'
and preparing for a winter campaign will materially assist
in shortening the war and rendering that preparation unnecessary.</p>

<p>"We have an awfully amusing chap here who is in
the Grenadier Guards. He is always imitating Harry Tate.
A great big hefty chap, in great big sloppy clothes (including
what are known as 'Prince of Wales' breeches). He gets
his mouth right over to the side of his face and says 'You
stupid boy!' in Harry Tate's voice. He does this in the
middle of our instructional squads when some wretched person
does something wrong with the gun, and sends every one
into fits of laughter.... [A lot more about a motor that
wouldn't go.]</p>

<p>"My M.G. course is going on very nicely. I have
learnt a very great deal, have been intensely interested,
and am very keen on the work. My function as a reserve
machine-gunner should really be to train the reserve team
and such parts of the main team as are not actually required
in the trenches, in a safe spot behind the lines! It sounds
'cushy,' but those in authority over us are not sufficiently
enlightened, I am afraid, to adopt such a plan. The object
of course is to prevent your reserve men from being 'used
up' as riflemen, as otherwise when you want them to take
the place of the others they are casualties and all their training
goes for nothing.</p>

<p>The Cavalry officers here are a great joke. They find
this life very tiring. They are quite keen to get back
again and have been from the beginning. We, on the other
hand, fairly enjoy it and are not at all anxious to go back
to our regiments. That shows the difference between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[ 55]</a></span>
lives we lead. Of course they <i>have</i> been in the trenches and
have had some very bad times there, but they only go in
in emergencies and at long intervals....</p>

<p>"Another difference between us is that they keep their
buttons as bright as possible and themselves as spick and
span as can be. The infantry officer gets his buttons as
dull as possible, and if they are green so much the better, as
it shows he has been through gas. He likes his clothes and
especially his puttees to be rather torn, and his hat to be
any old sloppy shape. If he gets a new hat he is almost
ashamed to wear it&mdash;he is terrified of being mistaken for
'Kitcheners'!</p>

<p>"Lord Kitchener and Mr. Asquith came here last evening.
Here, to this convent. I don't know what for; but there was
of course a good deal of stir here.</p>

<p>"Way and I went into the town last night. We hired
a <i>fiacre</i> for the return journey. It came on to rain, so it
was just as well we had a hood. We both thoroughly enjoyed
the journey. The <i>fiacre</i> was what would be dignified
by the name of 'Victoria' in England. But in France, where
it seems to be etiquette not to take any trouble over carriagework,
<i>fiacre</i> is the only word you could apply, and it just
fits it. It expresses not only its shabbiness but also hints
at its broken-backed appearance.</p>

<p>"We went into some stables and inquired about a <i>fiacre</i>,
and a fat boy in a blue apron with a white handkerchief
tied over one eye said we could have one. So I said, 'O�
est le cocher?' and he pointed to his breast and said,
'C'est moi!'</p>

<p>"The fare, he said, would be six francs and the <i>pourboire</i>.
Thoughtful of him not to forget that. We agreed,
and he eventually produced the usual French horse.</p>

<p>"The <i>fiacre</i> was very comfortable and we were awfully
tickled with the idea of us two in that absurd conveyance,
especially when we passed staff officers, which was frequently.
Altogether we were quite sorry when our drive
was over."

no light, so I have spent about two hours to-day turning
things round. I went to bed about three this morning

I had breakfast (bacon and eggs). As my former platoon

<p>"Here I am in the trenches again, quite like old times,
and quite in the swing again after the unsettling effect of
coming home! You know I can't help laughing at things
out here. The curious aspect of things sometimes comes
and hits me, and I sit down and laugh (not insanely or
hysterically, <i>bien entendu</i>; but I just can't help chuckling).
It is so absurd, the reasons and causes that have drawn
me to this particular and unlikely field in Belgium, and,
having arrived here, that make me set about at once house-hunting&mdash;for
all the world as if it was the most natural
thing in life. And having selected my little house and
arranged all my belongings in it, I regard it as home and
spend a few days there. And then one morning my servant
and I, we pack up everything once more and hoist
them on to our backs and set off, staff in hand, like a pair
of gipsies to another field a mile or so distant, and there
make a new home....</p>

<p>"I was very loth to leave my front line dug-out, because
I had arranged things to my liking&mdash;had moved the table
so that it caught the light, and so on. It had a built-in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[ 57]</a></span>
table (which took a lot of moving), a chair and a sandbag
bed. Quite small and snug.</p>

<p>"But still&mdash;this new dug-out back here is quite nice.
Large and roomy, with windows with bars in them (but
no glass)&mdash;a proper square table on four legs&mdash;three chairs
and a sandbag bed. So I am quite happy. The sandbag
bed is apparently made as follows: Cover a portion of the
floor, 6 feet 6 inches by 3 feet 6 inches, with a single layer
of sandbags filled with earth. Over these place several layers
of empty sandbags, and the bed is finished. If the hollows
and lumps are carefully placed, the former in the middle and
the latter at the head, the result is quite a success. Of course
one sleeps in one's clothes covered by a coat and with an
air pillow under one's head.</p>

<p>"We have had a very gay time in the trenches. I
think I told you how I saw a hostile aeroplane brought
down on fire in our lines. That was on Sunday, and the
official report says both pilots killed. On Monday I went
down to a support trench to have meat tea and a
chat with Holden and Ventris (two of C Company
officers). At a quarter to ten there was a loud rumbling
explosion and the dug-out we were in rocked for
several seconds. The Germans had fired a mine about 60
feet in front of our trench to try to blow in some of our
workings.</p>

<p>"I rushed to my guns&mdash;both were quite safe. You
should have heard the noise. Every man in the place
got up to the parapet and blazed away for all he was
worth. It was exciting! One machine gun fired two
belts (500 rounds), and the other fifty rounds. I heard
afterwards that several of the enemy were seen to leap
their parapets, but turned back when they heard the machine
guns open fire. It took a good while for things to
quieten down. Some of our miners were at work when
it went off, but their gallery was some way off and they
were quite all right.</p>

<p>"Last night they actually exploded another one! Aren't
they keen? This was a much smaller affair, but closer
to our trench. It shook down a portion of our parapet,
which was easily rebuilt and entombed temporarily
two of our miners. In neither case were there any
casualties....</p>

</p>

<p>"I am not actually in the trenches at the moment,
though most of the Battalion is. I was in for five days,
and then I was relieved about four days ago by another
officer (Roscoe), who shares with me the duties of machine-gun
officer. So I am in a dug-out about three-quarters of
a mile behind the firing line while he is taking his turn in
that line. (A mine has just gone off and shaken the ground,
followed by a burst of heavy rifle firing. This makes the
fourth mine this week! Two went off while I was up there,
and the whole earth rocked for several seconds. The first
three mines were theirs, this last may be ours, I don't know;
we had one ready!)</p>

<p>"We have been at Hill 60 and also up at Ypres. At
present we are south of that appalling place, but I learn
with regret that to-morrow we are moving again and are
going up north of Ypres. We are all depressed in consequence.</p>

<p>"What an awfully good letter you have written me;
but, do you know, it makes me ache all over when you
write like that about the car. You have only to mention
you have got a Rover, and I am as keen as mustard to
come and tinker with it! Aren't I young?</p>

<p>"But you must know I want to come to New Park
in any case. I am awfully keen to stay there and see it
from inside, and see its inmates again after many years
(it feels like). So after the war (may it be soon!) I am
just going to arrive. I may let you know!</p>

<p>"Your remarks on weddings in general depress me
very much! I hope the bridegroom's lot is better than
the poor bride's. Because my turn is bound to come!</p>

<p>"I am so glad Hester gave a good account of my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[ 59]</a></span>
appearance. I <i>am</i> very fit, it is the only way to exist here.
Once you begin to get 'down' and to worry, it is all up
with you. You go into a rapid decline, and eventually
arrive home a wreck! But as long as you smile and don't
care a hang about anything, well the war seems to go on
quite all right!</p>

<p>"I enjoyed my few days' leave very much indeed. I
had five days in England and three full days and four
nights at home. I dropped into my old life just as if
no change had occurred. And the time was not long
enough to make the getting back difficult.</p>

<p>"This life is a change for me, as you say. I haven't
done laughing at its humorous side yet. In some ways
we get treated like schoolboys. More so at Crosby than
here, however."</p>

</p>

<p>"I have been having rather a bad time lately,&mdash;one
of those times that reminds one that it is war
and not a picnic,&mdash;but, thank goodness, it is all over
now.</p>

<p>"I think I told you that we were about to move up
north of Ypres, to St. Julien or thereabouts. Well, just
before we handed over these trenches to one of Kitchener's
Battalions, the Germans went and knocked down a lot
of our parapet, and also sent over some appalling things
that we call 'sausages,' or 'aerial torpedoes,' though they
are not the latter. They are great shell-shaped affairs,
about 3 feet along and 9 inches in diameter, I should
think. They are visible during the whole of their flight.
They are thrown up about 100 yards into the air
and fall down as they go up, broadside on&mdash;not point
first. A few seconds after they fall there is the most
appalling explosion I have ever heard. From a distance
of 100 yards the rush of air is so strong that it feels
as if the thing had gone off close at hand. Luckily there
is a slight explosion when they are sent up, and, as I said,
they are visible all the time in the air. The result is our
men have time to dodge them, provided they are not mesmerised
as one man was. He got stuck with his mouth open,
pointing at one! A Corporal gave him a push which
sent him 10 yards, and the 'sausage' landed not far from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[ 60]</a></span>
where he had been. Although they have sent more than
twenty of these things over altogether, we have only
had one casualty, and that a scratch. Their effect is
to terrify every one and keep them on tenterhooks watching
for them. Their purpose is to destroy mine galleries,
I believe....</p>

<p>"Monday, August the 2nd, was the day we should have
been relieved, and that night I went up from headquarters
and relieved Roscoe, who had had a bad time in the fire
trenches....</p>

<p>"They were firing armour-piercing shells that go right
in and blow the parapet to blazes; dug-outs too, of course,
if they happen to be near. After punishing the right end of
the left-hand bit of trench, they traversed along, laying
waste the whole of our bit.</p>

<p>"I was in my dug-out with Hogg, another officer. I
was trying to make tea, but every shell blew out the
Primus, and covered us in dust. I made it, however,
eventually, and we had just drunk it when a shell blew
the parados of the trench down, not far from our door,
and the next wrecked the dug-out next door to mine (a
man who happened to be inside having a miraculous escape).
We judged it was time to clear (the machine guns had
already been withdrawn to safety), and got away as best
we could through and over the debris that had been a
trench.</p>

<p>"Later in the day I made my way back, and recovered
my pack and most of my belongings. It was exciting
work getting back, because they were sending whizz-bangs
through the gaps in the parapet, and the communication
trenches in the rear were blocked in places, so that
you had to get up on top and 'scoot' across and drop in
the trench again.</p>

<p>"That evening they gave us a second shelling, and one
hit my dug-out fair and square (I had quarters in a support
trench). When I returned next day for the rest of
my things&mdash;my equipment and some provisions&mdash;I had to
put two men on to dig them out. It took three-quarters of
an hour to get at them, through the wreckage of timber,
corrugated iron, and earth....</p>

<p>"On Tuesday afternoon they sent off another mine,&mdash;about
the seventh since we have been in,&mdash;but they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[ 61]</a></span>
all well in front of our parapet. And on Wednesday they
gave us twelve sausages&mdash;the first I had seen.</p>

<p>"The trouble is, we have a number of mine shafts under
the ground between our trenches and theirs, and they are
fearfully 'windy' about them. They keep trying to stop
us mining them, and their shelling is with the object of
blowing down our sap-heads. Their mines, too, go up
short, because they are trying to blow in our galleries; or
else they are so scared they send them off before they are
ready. I think the last explanation is probably more
near the truth, because when one of their mines went up
recently a lot of Germans went up with it!...</p>

<p>"We have been in here a fortnight to-night. You can
imagine how we long for clean clothes. Most of the
officers have not been out of their clothes all that time,
but I have been very lucky. I had two good cold baths
when I was down here before, and to-day I had a lovely
hot one in a full-length wooden bath. A tremendous luxury!
Also I had some clean socks to put on....</p>

<p>"On the day I was shelled out of my dug-out my servant,
Bailey, was hit on the leg by a piece of shell and has gone
down the line wounded, not very seriously, I think. He
is a great loss to me, but I have got another one now,
Gray, who shapes very well. He is young and willing, and
quite intelligent.</p>

<p>"You ask whether that time when the mine went off
was the first time I had used these guns. Yes, absolutely.
The plan adopted in trench warfare is to place your guns
in position with a good wide loophole in front of them,
then block this up and keep a sharp look-out. When the
enemy attacks, you blaze away at them, and then shift
hurriedly to another gun-position and watch the old one
being shelled to blazes.</p>

<p>"If you fire on other occasions you are rather apt to
have your guns knocked out, and we can't afford to lose
<i>any</i>. That is why I was rather horrified to find one gun
had fired 500 rounds the other night. However, it was not
discovered. I think the long grass in front hid the
flashes....</p>

<p>"Yes, the sandbags might be damp when used for a
bed, and I always lay my waterproof ground-sheet on top
of them. I either sleep on that or on some new clean bags
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[ 62]</a></span>
laid above that again. It is not only dampness, though, that
one fears!</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, one is not very sensitive to damp
when living so much out of doors. It is common to get
one's feet slightly wet and go for about four days without
removing one's boots&mdash;most unpleasant, but not in the least
damaging to health."

I did nineteen days, and some did a few more days than
that. Three weeks is a long time to live continuously in
clothes, boots, and puttees....</p>

<p>"I came out of the trenches on Thursday night, and
was really a day too soon, because on Friday we were
having Orderly-Room right in the country, in front of the
C.O.'s tent; the Colonel was there surrounded by most of
the officers, when we heard a shell. Well, that's nothing
unusual, but this one got crescendo, and we all looked up
in alarm. Then it got very crescendo, and finally cleared
us and landed with a loud explosion about 50 yards beyond
us, and not far from several groups of men. It was
an 8-inch 'crump.' One man only was killed, but we
knew that more were likely to come over, and so we gradually
spread out to the sides. Four came altogether at two-minute
intervals, but we only had two casualties. Rather
upsetting when we were supposed to be resting. I don't
know whether they could see our (officers') white tents, or
whether they saw the cricket match that took place on
the day before.</p>

<p>"Anyway we moved our tents slightly&mdash;every one put
their tents where they pleased, and then the Pioneer Sergeant
came and amused himself daubing green paint on
them in patches. Ours (three of C Coy.) was the best;
the splodges looked just like hazel nuts (?) when there
are three together in their little green cases, and they were
interspersed with a kind of pansy-shaped flower. Altogether
a very tasteful and pleasing effect....</p>

<p>"I am having a very quiet and lazy time at the moment,
and feel I deserve it. We went into support trenches
for three days, and worked two nights from 7.30 p.m.
till 3 a.m. building and improving the fire trench. Then
on the third night we had a most exciting time. One
company, under Captain Taylor, was sent up right in front
to dig a new fire trench to connect with another on our left.
We had to go up a trench which ran right out into space, and
which had only just been built itself, and when there we had
to get over the parapet and creep forward to the new
line we were to dig. Of course we had to be dead
quiet, but there was a big moon, and of course they
saw us. Most of the way we were not more than
30 yards away from their front position (and they had
bombing parties out in front of that). While we were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[ 64]</a></span>
digging we had one platoon with bombs to cover us, and
some of this party were as close as 25 yards to their front
position. It was awful work, because they kept throwing
bombs at us, and what was almost worse was the close-range
sniping.</p>

<p>"'Very' lights were going up from the German lines
all the time, and you could see the bullets kicking up the
dust all around. When we first got out there I picked
out my ground pretty carefully before lying down (because
the recent scrap there was much in evidence), but
when the snipers got busy I didn't worry about what I
was on, I just hugged the ground as close as I could. They
would put the 'Very' lights right into us, and one just
missed me by a yard. If they are not spent when they
come down, they blaze fiercely on the ground, and when
they finish, they look like a little coke fire. They would
burn you badly if they fell on you. I have seen a dead
man that one had fallen on afterwards. His clothes were
fearfully burned.</p>

<p>"The Germans were on the edge of a wood and our
ground was tipped towards them, so it was extremely difficult
to get cover. Shell holes were the best. Soon the
men got their trenches down, and things were a little better.
The men worked extremely well, and the Wilts were working
on our left, and we eventually joined up with them.
After about five hours' work, the trenches were fit to hold,
and we filed out and the new garrison filed in. Our casualties
were much lighter than I should have thought possible.
The Colonel came along the new trenches just before
we left, and he was most awfully pleased with C Company,
and so is the General. Captain Taylor is very
bucked about it.</p>

<p>"The scene of this affair was right against the Ch�teau
of Hooge, and close to the mine crater. We found a German
machine gun half buried, but in good condition, and
any number of souvenirs. The Captain has got a helmet&mdash;a
dirty thing; he had to have it cleaned out, because
part of the owner was still inside it! It is a rummy
shape, so flat-topped and square, with a brass spike
and a gold band down the back. I expect it was an
officer's.</p>

I was standing up and a 'Very' light went up, so I
kept perfectly still. I was looking towards the wood where
the Germans were (I was 40 or 50 yards away), and I saw
one quite distinctly walking into the wood.</p>

<p>"Our men that were killed (sniped) were buried just
behind, within a quarter of an hour of being hit. Rather
awful.</p>

<p>"The actual digging was rather trying in places, and in
one case they actually came on a horse!&mdash;which dates it
back to November, when we were pushed back to these
positions in the first battle of Ypres.</p>

<p>"The men in such places work with their respirators
on and are often actually sick. I have had whiffs of the
smell since in my food. Once smelt never forgotten. I can
tell the difference between a man and a horse, but I don't
know which I like least.</p>

<p>"Rather a morbid topic, I am afraid. Well, after leaving
the scene of our labours (and glad to get out), we
called for our packs and had to march about two and a
half miles. We were dead beat when we arrived here
(nice safe dug-outs&mdash;roomy and comfortable&mdash;with our
valises ready to sleep in when we arrived), but we found a
good meal awaiting us, and about half-past four we 'got
down to it' and slept till noon. Holden and I share a
palatial dug-out, and we had breakfast in bed, and I did
not get up till just before our evening meal at 7. I washed
and dressed in slacks&mdash;had a meal, and later on went to
bed again. This morning we had breakfast in bed again
about 9.30, and then I got up, washed and shaved, dressed,
and am now sitting on my bed, leaning against the wall
writing my letters.</p>

<p>"The General let us off 'stand-to' because he knew we
were fagged out; and it is a great mercy. Turning out
fully dressed at about 2.30 a.m. and remaining up for an
hour does not improve one's night's rest. I suppose, though,
that we shall have to start it soon&mdash;perhaps to-night.</p>

<p>"We are here till to-morrow night, I believe, and then
we go to some fairly nice trenches near the ones we were
in last. We are short of subalterns&mdash;rather&mdash;and they
have taken me off machine guns for the time being. I <i>am</i>
sick, but I get a bit in when I can. In the last trench we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[ 66]</a></span>
built (I and my platoon), not the exposed one, there was
a machine-gun position, and I took great pleasure in building
it a really good emplacement....</p>

<p>"Are you doing anything about getting me back for
Munitions? I don't know what you think about it, and
whether you think I ought to carry on out here. I am
sure that after six months I shall be just about fed-up
with this business, but am not sure that after a couple of
months at home I shan't be wanting to come out again."

"<i>Wednesday, 1 September 1915, 4.45 p.m.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"I will just write you a short letter to let you know
I am still well and happy, and still leading the strange life
of the picnic-hermit.</p>

<p>"When I last wrote to you I believe I was in the very
same spot as now, namely, support trenches in the neighbourhood
of a now famous ch�teau. Last time we were in
for three days, and on the night we left we had a very
blood-curdling experience digging a trench which was to
bring us closer to our friends the enemy. But they were
inclined to resent our advances, and they welcomed us, not
with open arms, but with lighted bombs. However, having
completed our work to the great satisfaction of those in
authority over us (namely, the Colonel and the General
[Brigadier]), we made good our escape.</p>

<p>"Then for three blissful days we lived (with our valises)
in some magnificent dug-outs in one of the safest
spots in this accursed though much improved neighbourhood.
These days we spent competing who could sleep
furthest round the clock (if that is a permissible expression).
I think I won, and on my record day I got up
and dressed for dinner at about 7.30 p.m., made my bed
afterwards, and got back into it again. This halcyon
period was only interrupted once, when we all had to go
out and dig a trench one night long. However, the worst
feature of this expedition was the rain, which made 'going'
very difficult, and things in general rather uncomfortable
(especially for the men), so we hadn't much to grumble
about.</p>

<p>"Then we came back here and the first night we slept
in peace, getting up at about 3 a.m. ostensibly for the
purpose of 'stand-to,' but really to brew ourselves some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[ 67]</a></span>
cocoa. Then sleep till 9, 10, or 11, I forget which. I
crawl to the door of my dug-out and shout for Gray,
who lives just opposite. 'Breakfast!' I say, and he invariably
asks, 'What will you have, sir?' just as if he could
command the larders of the Carlton or the Linga.</p>

<p>"Knowing my rations, and that an attempt at humour
would only put me off my <i>plat du jour</i> or daily
round, I usually think for a few moments and then order
eggs and bacon, and face the common task. The only
variation I permit myself is that on one or two days in
the week I funk the bacon and have boiled eggs. Where
do the eggs come from? They are purchased out of the
Mess fund by our Mess cook who lives with the
Transport when we are in the trenches, and brings them
up personally when the rations arrive at night. Yes, he
has a 'cushy' time of it, does our Mess cook; and
how can he avoid being happy, living as he does in a perpetual
transport?</p>

<p>"What of the days when no eggs are available?
Why, then, <i>horrible dictu</i>, I have fried cheese and
bacon!</p>

<p>"It occurs to me here, although all this was not written
with intention, that this could be a good place to ask
whether sausages are yet in season. If they are, a few
cooked ones (or half cooked) sent out now and again would
make a splendid variant for our menu.</p>

<p>"The meat season is hard to follow out here. Bully
beef is such a hardy perennial. (This does not mean that
we live on it&mdash;I never eat it, there is always a good supply
of fresh beef.)</p>

<p>"Blackberries are coming on, I notice with pleasure,
and I can usually tell what shells are in season (the season
for sausages in this department is, let us hope, mercifully
short. I believe we are now in the middle of the close-time
for this sturdy little fellow, I trust he is not utilising it to
increase and multiply).</p>

<p>"I am sorry I have had rather a sharp attack of parentheses
lately, the touch of winter in the air cramps my style.
And I really did think this was going to be quite a short
letter. I cannot divine my moods, I find, I did not feel like
writing until I got going.</p>

<p>"Please thank father very much indeed for the sniperscopes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[ 68]</a></span>
I have given one to the Captain of D Company,
who is keen on everything. He is an engineer (civil), and
is a most useful man out here. I have not tried mine yet,
as I haven't been in a fire trench, and it would hardly be
fair to use it in a support trench, the backs of our infantry
in the trench in front being too easy a target to give the thing
a fair trial.</p>

<p>"Oh! I was telling you about my work in this trench but
got switched off on to food. Last time I was here I
(and my platoon) worked for two nights from 7.30 till 3
improving the parapets. Well, the second night of <i>this</i>
period (last night) I had got all sorts of plans ready and
was going to have a thoroughly good night building dug-outs,
draining the trench, and building a second machine-gun
emplacement (not my job really at the moment). However,
word came along that the platoon was wanted
to dig another trench right in front again and near
the other one. They said, 'A covering party with bombs
will be provided, and send in your casualty report in the
morning!' So I asked if they were supplying stretchers and
all complete! But they were not. It is a most cheering
way of sending you off, is it not? It is a wonder they
did not make us take up our own grave crosses, just in
case.</p>

<p>"(By the way, it is most impressive to meet two men
walking along at night and one carrying a large white cross.
The burying and decking of the graves is done very well
here, and conscientiously. There is a special organisation
for making the crosses, lettering them and putting them up.
The position of the grave is reported to them, with the particulars,
and they do the rest.)</p>

<p>"The great difference in last night's job was that I
only had a platoon to deal with, while before the Captain
had a whole company. Also I was not quite so close to
the enemy (we were 30 yards off, and less, before), and the
moon was mostly obscured. I determined not to let them
know we were working, so I crept out and explored the
ground with the Corporal of the covering party (this was the
worst part of the job, because you did not know when you
might not come across a party of the enemy in the many
shell holes and old trenches with which the ground was covered).
I had my large revolver in my pocket, but I did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[ 69]</a></span>
want to use it, as it would have given our game
away.</p>

<p>"All went well, and I got the men placed out in absolute
silence, with the covering party pushed out in front
to listen and watch. The men worked very quietly, and
when a light went up they got down and kept still. Lights
were very few, because the enemy had got a working party
out too&mdash;at one side, and we could occasionally hear them
driving in stakes for wire.</p>

<p>"We had to use picks in some places where the ground
was stony, and these are the hardest to keep quiet. We got
through it all right, and only one shot, I think, was fired
all the time. It came fairly close, too. I am sure
they guessed we were out, because when one light went
up I hadn't time to get down, so I kept still and
I plainly saw a Hun standing upright on his own parapet.
He straightened up as the light grew bright, and I
just caught sight of the movement and saw him then distinctly.</p>

<p>"The ground out there has been fought over a good
deal, and there are plenty of souvenirs about. I have got
one myself&mdash;a Hun rifle. The original owner, who was
buried with it&mdash;probably by a shell&mdash;happened to lie exactly
where we dug our trench, and we were obliged to move
him elsewhere. I brought his rifle home and put it over the
door of my dug-out. That was early this morning. But
the enemy have been putting shrapnel over us (in reply to
a good 'strafing' by our guns), and one piece has gone clean
through the stock.</p>

<p>"Our artillery are going great guns nowadays. It
certainly feels as if the shell supply was all right&mdash;or nearly
so.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether we shall be wanted for any job
to-night, or whether we shall rest, or whether I can get on
with my projects. I must go round and see Captain T. in
the other trench. By the way, he came to see how I was
getting on last night about midnight, and was very pleased
with the work and with the fact that we were having no
casualties.</p>

<p>"That cake was fine, and much appreciated in the Mess.
The little knife you gave me when home on leave is proving
most useful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[ 70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Please thank Lionel for chocolate received and Alec for
gourdoulis.</p>

<p>"I have sent another box of Surplus Kit home addressed
to No�l. Rather late to do it, I know, and I shall
want one or two of the things sent back later, but not
for a long time, and it is a relief to get rid of some of my
impedimenta. The socks returned want mending. That
reminds me, thank you and please thank Miss Leith very
much for the socks. They are quite all right for size. Perhaps
not so long and narrow in the foot might be better,
but it doesn't seem to affect the wear; they are most comfortable.</p>

guns&mdash;much to my annoyance."

me off machine guns for the present, I hope it may not

My conduct would have given me double pneumonia at
home. My rain-coat was soaked, so I had to sleep in
shirt sleeves under my tunic, and the knees of my breeches
were wet.</p>

<p>"The next day the rain was incessant, and presently
I found the floor of my dug-out was swimming&mdash;the water
having welled up through the ground below and the sandbags.</p>

<p>"I didn't have to sleep on it luckily, because we were
relieved that night. But before we went I had to turn
out with fifty men and work till midnight in water up to
one foot deep. So at 8.30 p.m. I got my boots full of cold
water and sat out in them till 12, then marched some
eight miles. After nine hours' rest and some breakfast

we came here, another three or four. It was nice to get
a dry pair of boots and our valises and a tent.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Letter From Lieutenant William Roscoe<br />
To Sir Oliver Lodge</span></h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
"<i>7th Brigade Machine-Gun Company,<br />
B.E.F., 16 May 1916</i><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir Oliver Lodge</span>,&mdash;When I was lately on leave,
a brother of mine, who had met one of your relatives,
encouraged me to write and tell you what I knew of your
son Raymond. I was in the South Lancashire Regiment
when he joined the Battalion out here last spring, and I
think spent the first spell he had in the trenches in his
company.</p>

<p>"Afterwards I became Machine Gunner, and in the
summer he became my assistant, and working in shifts
we tided over some very trying times indeed. In particular
during August at St. Eloi. To me at any rate it was
most pleasant being associated together, and I think he
very much preferred work with the gunners to Company
work. Being of a mechanical turn of mind, he was always
devising some new 'gadget' for use with the gun&mdash;for
instance, a mounting for firing at aeroplanes, and a device
for automatic traversing; and those of my men who knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[ 74]</a></span>
him still quote him as their authority when laying down the
law and arguing about machine gunning.</p>

<p>"I wish we had more like him, and the endless possibilities
of the Maxim would be more quickly brought to
light.</p>

<p>"I am always glad to think that it was not in any
way under my responsibility that he was killed.</p>

<p>"During September times grew worse and worse up
in the Ypres salient, culminating in the attack we made on
the 25th, auxiliary to the Loos battle. The trenches were
ruins, there was endless work building them up at night,
generally to be wrecked again the next day. The place
was the target for every gun for miles on either side of
the salient.</p>

<p>"Every day our guns gave the enemy a severe bombardment,
in preparation for the attack, and every third or fourth
day we took it back from them with interest: the place was
at all times a shell trap.</p>

<p>"It was during this time that your son was killed. He
was doing duty again with the Company, which was short-handed,
and I remember one night in particular being
struck with his cheerfulness on turning out to a particularly
unpleasant bit of trench digging in front of our lines near
the Stables at Hooge, a mass of ruins and broken trenches
where no one could tell you where you might run across
the enemy; but the men had to dig for hours on end, with
only a small covering party looking out a few yards in front
of them.</p>

<p>"The morning your son was killed they were bombarding
our trenches on the top of the hill, and some of the
men were being withdrawn from a bad piece. He and
Ventris were moving down the trench in rear of the party&mdash;which
I think must have been seen&mdash;for a shell came and
hit them both, but I think none of the men in front.</p>

<p>"Some time later, I don't know how long, I was going
up to the line to visit the guns, when I saw Ventris, who
was killed, laid out ready to be carried down, and presently
I saw your son in a dug-out, with a man watching
him. He was then quite unconscious though still breathing
with difficulty. I could see it was all over with him.
He was still just alive when I went away.</p>

<p>"Our regiment was to lose many more on that same hill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[ 75]</a></span>
before the month was over, and those of us that remain
are glad to be far away from it now; but I always feel
that anyone who has died on Hooge Hill has at all events
died in very fine company.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="right">"<i>Thursday, 23 September 1915</i></p>

<p>"Yes, I knew Raymond Lodge very well, and he was
indeed a friend of mine, being one of the nicest fellows it
has ever been my privilege to meet. I was with him when
he died. This was how it happened to the best of my
knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[ 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"'A' Company (the one I am in) and 'C' Company
were in the trenches at the time. The gunners had sent
up word that there was going to be a bombardment, and
so they recommended us to evacuate the front-line trenches,
in case the Hun retaliated, and it was whilst C Company
were proceeding down the communication trench, till
the bombardment was over, that the shell came which
killed your brother. He was in command of C Company
at the time, and was going down at the rear of his
men, having seen them all safely out of the trenches.
His servant, Gray, was hit first, in the head (from which
he afterwards died). Then Lodge went along to tell the
Sergeant-Major, and to see about assistance, farther down
the trench. Whilst talking to the Company Sergeant-Major
he was hit in the left side of the back, by a piece of shell,
I think. Lower down the trench poor Ventris was hit
and killed. As soon as I heard about it I went along to
see if I could be of any use. I saw Lodge lying in a dug-out,

hit, and tried to cheer him up. He recognised me and
was just able to ask a few questions. That must have
been about twenty minutes or so after he was hit. I think
he lived about half an hour, and I don't think he suffered
much pain, thank God.</p>

of the very nicest fellows I have met. That he was universally
liked, both by officers and men, it is needless to

<p>"First of all I beg to offer you and your family my
sincere sympathies in the loss of your son, 2nd Lieut.
Lodge. His loss to us is very great: he was a charming
young fellow&mdash;always so very cheerful and willing, hard
working, and a bright example of what a good soldier
ought to be. He was a most efficient officer, and only
recently qualified in the handling and command of Maxim
guns&mdash;a most useful accomplishment in the present war.
Briefly, the circumstances which led to his death were as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On 14 September, C Company to which 2nd Lieut.
Lodge belonged, was in position in a forward fire trench.
During the morning the commander of the artillery
covering the position informed 2nd Lieut. Lodge, who at
the time was in command of C Company, that it was intended
to shell the enemy's positions, and as his trenches
were only a short distance from ours, it was considered
advisable to withdraw from our trench during the shelling.
2nd Lieut. Lodge gave orders for his Company to withdraw
into a communication trench in the rear. He and
2nd Lieut. Ventris were the last to leave the forward
trench, and in entering the communication trench both
these officers were caught by enemy's shrapnel. Ventris
was killed&mdash;Lodge mortally wounded and died of his
wounds shortly afterwards. These are the circumstances of
his death."</p>

<p>"The Colonel has asked me to write you, giving some
idea of the burial-ground in which your son's grave is. I
understand that he was leading his Company back from
one of the communication trenches when the Germans
shelled the front and rear of the column, killing your son
and the officer who was at the rear. At the same time
one man was killed and two wounded. I knew nothing
about this until later in the day, as communication with
my aid post was very difficult, and he was reported to
me as having been killed. I understand that he lived
for about three hours after being wounded, and all the
officers and men who were present speak very highly of
his conduct during this time. His wound was unfortunately
in such a position that there was no chance of saving
his life, and this was recognised by all, including
your son himself. When his body was brought down in
the evening the expression on his face was absolutely
peaceful, and I should think that he probably did not
suffer a great deal of pain. He was buried on the same
evening in our cemetery just outside the aid post, side by
side with Lieut. Ventris, who was unfortunately killed
on the same day. The cemetery is in the garden adjoining
a ruined farm-house. It is well enclosed by hedges,
and your son's grave is under some tall trees that stand
in the garden. There are graves there of men of many
regiments who have fallen, and our graves are enclosed by
a wire fence, so keeping them quite distinct from the others.
There is a wooden cross marking the head of the grave,
and a small one at the foot. I am afraid that our condolences
will be small consolation to you, but I can assure
you that he was one of the most popular officers with the
Battalion, both amongst the officers and men, and all feel
his loss very greatly."</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I HAVE made no secret of my conviction, not merely
that personality persists, but that its continued
existence is more entwined with the life of every day
than has been generally imagined; that there is no real
breach of continuity between the dead and the living;
and that methods of intercommunion across what has
seemed to be a gulf can be set going in response to the
urgent demand of affection,&mdash;that in fact, as Diotima told
Socrates (<i>Symposium</i>, 202 and 203), <span class="smcap">Love bridges the
chasm</span>.</p>

<p>Nor is it affection only that controls and empowers
supernormal intercourse: scientific interest and missionary
zeal constitute supplementary motives which are found
efficacious; and it has been mainly through efforts so
actuated that I and some others have been gradually
convinced, by direct experience, of a fact which before
long must become patent to mankind.</p>

<p>Hitherto I have testified to occurrences and messages
of which the motive is intellectual rather than emotional:
and though much, very much, even of this evidence
remains inaccessible to the public, yet a good deal has
appeared from time to time by many writers in the
<i>Proceedings</i> of the Society for Psychical Research,
and in my personal collection called <i>The Survival of
Man</i>. No one therefore will be surprised if I now
further testify concerning communications which come
home to me in a peculiar sense; communications from
which sentiment is not excluded, though still they appear
to be guided and managed with intelligent and on the
whole evidential purpose. These are what I now decide
to publish; and I shall cite them as among those evidences
for survival for the publication of which some legitimate
demand has of late been made, owing to my having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[ 84]</a></span>
declared my belief in continued existence without being
able to give the full grounds of that belief, because much
of it concerned other people. The portion of evidence I
shall now cite concerns only myself and family.</p>

<p>I must make selection, it is true, for the bulk has
become great; but I shall try to select fairly, and especially
shall give in fair fulness those early communications
which, though not so free and easy as they became with
more experience, have yet an interest of their own, since
they represent nascent powers and were being received
through members of the family to whom the medium was
a complete stranger and who gave no clue to identity.</p>

<p>Messages of an intelligible though rather recondite
character from "Myers" began to reach me indeed a
week or two before the death of my son; and nearly all
the messages received since his death differ greatly in
character from those which in the old days were received
through any medium with whom I sat. No youth was
then represented as eager to communicate; and though
friends were described as sending messages, the messages
were represented as coming from appropriate people&mdash;members
of an elder generation, leaders of the Society
for Psychical Research, and personal acquaintances.
Whereas now, whenever any member of the family visits
anonymously a competent medium, the same youth soon
comes to the fore and is represented as eager to prove his
personal survival and identity.</p>

<p>I consider that he has done so. And the family
scepticism, which up to this time has been sufficiently
strong, is now, I may fairly say, overborne by the facts.
How far these facts can be conveyed to the sympathetic
understanding of strangers, I am doubtful. But I must
plead for a patient hearing; and if I make mistakes,
either in what I include, or in what for brevity I omit, or
if my notes and comments fail in clearness, I bespeak a
friendly interpretation: for it is truly from a sense of duty
that in so personal a matter I lay myself open to harsh and
perhaps cynical criticism.</p>

<p>It may be said&mdash;Why attach so much importance to
one individual case? I do not attach especial importance
to it, but every individual case is of moment, because
in such a matter the aphorism <i>Ex uno disce omnes</i> is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[ 85]</a></span>
strictly applicable. If we can establish the survival of
any single ordinary individual we have established it
for all.</p>

<p>Christians may say that the case for one Individual
was established nearly 1900 years ago; but they have
most of them confused the issue by excessive though
perhaps legitimate and necessary emphasis on the exceptional
and unique character of that Personality. And
a school of thought has arisen which teaches that ordinary
men can only attain immortality vicariously&mdash;that is,
conditionally on acceptance of a certain view concerning
the benefits of that Sacrificial Act, and active assimilation
of them.</p>

<p>So without arguing on any such subject, and without
entering in the slightest degree on any theological question,
I have endeavoured to state the evidence fully and frankly
for the persistent existence of one of the multitude of
youths who have sacrificed their lives at the call of their
Country when endangered by an aggressor of calculated
ruthlessness.</p>

<p>Some critics may claim that there are many stronger
cases of established survival. That may be, but this is a
case which touches me closely and has necessarily received
my careful attention. In so far as there are other strong
cases&mdash;and I know of several&mdash;so much the better. I myself
considered the case of survival practically proven
before, and clinched by the efforts of Myers and others of
the S.P.R. group on the other side; but evidence is cumulative,
and the discussion of a fresh case in no way weakens
those that have gone before. Each stick of the faggot
must be tested, and, unless absolutely broken, it adds to the
strength of the bundle.</p>

<p>To base so momentous a conclusion as a scientific
demonstration of human survival on any single instance, if
it were not sustained on all sides by a great consensus of
similar evidence, would doubtless be unwise; for some
other explanation of a merely isolated case would have
to be sought. But we are justified in examining the evidence
for any case of which all the details are known, and
in trying to set forth the truth of it as completely and fairly
as we may.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><span class="gesperrt">CHAPTER I</span><br />
<span class="small">ELEMENTARY EXPLANATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOR people who have studied psychical matters, or
who have read any books on the subject, it is unnecessary
to explain what a 'sitting' is. Novices must
be asked to refer to other writings&mdash;to small books, for
instance, by Sir W. F. Barrett or Mr. J. Arthur Hill or
Miss H. A. Dallas, which are easily accessible, or to my
own previous book on this subject called <i>The Survival of
Man</i>, which begins more at the beginning so far as my own
experience is concerned.</p>

<p>Of mediumship there are many grades, one of the
simplest forms being the capacity to receive an impression
or automatic writing, under peaceful conditions, in an ordinary
state; but the whole subject is too large to be treated
here. Suffice it to say that the kind of medium chiefly
dealt with in this book is one who, by waiting quietly,
goes more or less into a trance, and is then subject to
what is called 'control'&mdash;speaking or writing in a manner
quite different from the medium's own normal or customary
manner, under the guidance of a separate intelligence
technically known as 'a control,' which some think must
be a secondary personality&mdash;which indeed certainly is a
secondary personality of the medium, whatever that phrase
may really signify&mdash;the transition being effected in most
cases quite easily and naturally. In this secondary state,
a degree of clairvoyance or lucidity is attained quite beyond
the medium's normal consciousness, and facts are referred
to which must be outside his or her normal knowledge.
The control, or second personality which speaks during the
trance, appears to be more closely in touch with what is
popularly spoken of as 'the next world' than with customary
human existence, and accordingly is able to get messages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[ 87]</a></span>
through from people deceased; transmitting them
through the speech or writing of the medium, usually with
some obscurity and misunderstanding, and with mannerisms
belonging either to the medium or to the control.
The amount of sophistication varies according to the quality
of the medium, and to the state of the same medium
at different times; it must be attributed in the best cases
physiologically to the medium, intellectually to the control.
The confusion is no greater than might be expected from
a pair of operators, connected by a telephone of rather
delicate and uncertain quality, who were engaged in transmitting
messages between two stranger communicators,
one of whom was anxious to get messages transmitted,
though perhaps not very skilled in wording them, while
the other was nearly silent and anxious not to give any
information or assistance at all; being, indeed, more or
less suspicious that the whole appearance of things was
deceptive, and that his friend, the ostensible communicator,
was not really there. Under such circumstances the
effort of the distant communicator would be chiefly directed
to sending such natural and appropriate messages
as should gradually break down the inevitable scepticism of
his friend.</p>

<h3>Further Preliminary Explanation</h3>

<p>I must assume it known that messages purporting to
come from various deceased people have been received
through various mediums, and that the Society for
Psychical Research has especially studied those coming
through Mrs. Piper&mdash;a resident in the neighbourhood of
Boston, U.S.A.&mdash;during the past thirty years. We were
introduced to her by Professor William James. My own
experience with this lady began during her visit to this
country in 1889, and was renewed in 1906. The account
has been fully published in the <i>Proceedings</i> of the
Society for Psychical Research, vols. vi. and xxiii., and
an abbreviated version of some of the incidents there
recorded can be referred to in my book <i>The Survival
of Man</i>.</p>

<p>It will be convenient, however, to explain here that
some of the communicators on the other side, like Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[ 88]</a></span>
Myers and Dr. Richard Hodgson, both now deceased, have
appeared to utilise many mediums; and that to allow
for possible sophistication by normal mental idiosyncrasies,
and for any natural warping due to the physiological
mechanism employed, or to the brain-deposit from
which selection has to be made, we write the name of the
ostensible communicator in each case with a suffix&mdash;like
Myers<sub>P</sub>, Myers<sub>V</sub>, etc.; meaning by this kind of designation
to signify that part of the Myers-like intelligence which
operates through Mrs. Piper or through Mrs. Verrall, etc.,
respectively.</p>

<p>We know that communication must be hampered, and
its form largely determined, by the unconscious but inevitable
influence of a transmitting mechanism, whether
that be of a merely mechanical or of a physiological character.
Every artist knows that he must adapt the expression
of his thought to his material, and that what is possible
with one 'medium,' even in the artist's sense of the word,
is not possible with another.</p>

<p>And when the method of communication is purely
mental or telepathic, we are assured that the communicator
'on the other side' has to select from and utilise those
ideas and channels which represent the customary mental
scope of the medium; though by practised skill and ingenuity
they can be woven into fresh patterns and be made
to convey to a patient and discriminating interpreter the
real intention of the communicator's thought. In many
such telepathic communications the physical form which
the emergent message takes is that of automatic or semiconscious
writing or speech; the manner of the utterance
being fairly normal, but the substance of it appearing not
to emanate from the writer's or speaker's own mind:
though but very seldom is either the subject-matter or the
language of a kind quite beyond the writer's or speaker's
normal capabilities.</p>

<p>In other cases, when the medium becomes entranced,
the demonstration of a communicator's separate intelligence
may become stronger and the sophistication less. A
still further stage is reached when by special effort what is
called <i>telergy</i> is employed, <i>i.e.</i> when physiological mechanism
is more directly utilised without telepathic operation
on the mind. And a still further step away from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[ 89]</a></span>
personal sophistication, though under extra mechanical difficulties,
is attainable in <i>telekinesis</i> or what appears to be
the direct movement of inorganic matter. To this last category&mdash;though
in its very simplest form&mdash;must belong, I
suppose, the percussive sounds known as raps.</p>

<p>To understand the intelligent tiltings of a table in contact
with human muscles is a much simpler matter. It is
crude and elementary, but in principle it does not appear
to differ from automatic writing; though inasmuch as the
code and the movements are so simple, it appears to be the
easiest of all to beginners. It is so simple that it has been
often employed as a sort of game, and so has fallen into
disrepute. But its possibilities are not to be ignored for all
that; and in so far as it enables a feeling of more direct
influence&mdash;in so far as the communicator feels able himself
to control the energy necessary, instead of having to
entrust his message to a third person&mdash;it is by many communicators
preferred. More on this subject will be found
in Chapters <a href="#Page_137">VIII of Part II</a> and <a href="#Page_362">XIV of Part III.</a></p>

<p>Before beginning an historical record of the communications
and messages received from or about my
son since his death, I think it will be well to prelude it
by&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<ol class="rom">
  <li> A message which arrived before the event;</li>
  <li> A selection of subsequent communications bearing on and supplementing<br />
<span style="margin-left:1.5em;">this message;</span></li>
  <li> One of the evidential episodes, selected from subsequent communications,<br />
<span style="margin-left:1.8em;">which turned out to be exactly verifiable.</span></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>A few further details about these things, and another series
of messages of evidential importance, will be found in that
Part of the <i>Proceedings</i> of the S.P.R. which is to be published
about October 1916.</p>

<p>If the full discussion allowed to these selected portions
appears rather complicated, an unstudious reader may skip
the next three chapters, on a first reading, and may learn
about the simpler facts in their evolutionary or historical
order.</p>

<span class="small">THE 'FAUNUS' MESSAGE</span></h2>
</div>

<h3><i>Preliminary Facts</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Raymond</span> joined the Army in September 1914; trained near
Liverpool and Edinburgh with the South Lancashires, and
in March 1915 was sent to the trenches in Flanders. In
the middle of July 1915 he had a few days' leave at home,
and on the 20th returned to the Front.
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Initial 'Piper' Message</span></h3>

<p>The first intimation that I had that anything might be
going wrong, was a message from Myers through Mrs.
Piper in America; communicated apparently by "Richard
Hodgson" at a time when a Miss Robbins was having a
sitting at Mrs. Piper's house, Greenfield, New Hampshire,
on 8 August 1915, and sent me by Miss Alta Piper (A. L.
P.) together with the original script. Here follows the
extract, which at a certain stage in Miss Robbins's sitting,
after having dealt with matters of personal significance to
her, none of which had anything whatever to do with me,
began abruptly thus:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. H.</span>&mdash;Now Lodge, while we are not here as of old, <i>i.e.</i>
not quite, we are here enough to take and give messages.</p>

<p>Myers says you take the part of the poet, and he
will act as Faunus. <span class="smcap">Faunus.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss R.</span>&mdash;Faunus?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. H.</span>&mdash;Yes. Myers. <i>Protect.</i>
He will understand.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">(Evidently referring to Lodge.&mdash;A. L. P.)</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>What have you to say, Lodge? Good work.
Ask Verrall, she will also understand. Arthur
says so. [This means Dr. Arthur W. Verrall
(deceased).&mdash;O. J. L.]</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[ 91]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss R.</span>&mdash;Do you mean Arthur Tennyson?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">

<p>[This absurd confusion, stimulated by the word
'poet,' was evidently the result of a long strain at
reading barely legible trance-writing for more than
an hour, and was recognised immediately afterwards
with dismayed amusement by the sitter. It
is only of interest as showing how completely unknown
to anyone present was the reference intended
by the communicator.&mdash;O. J. L.]
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">R. H.</span>&mdash;<i>No. Myers</i> knows. So does &mdash;&mdash;. You
got mixed (to Miss R.), but Myers is straight about
Poet and Faunus.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>I venture to say that to non-classical people the above
message conveys nothing. It did not convey anything to
me, beyond the assurance, based on past experience, that
it certainly meant something definite, that its meaning was
probably embedded in a classical quotation, and that a
scholar like Mrs. Verrall would be able to interpret it,
even if only the bare skeleton of the message were given
without any details as to source.
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Letter from Mrs. Verrall</span></h3>

<p>In order to interpret this message, therefore, I wrote
to Mrs. Verrall as instructed, asking her: "Does <i>The Poet
and Faunus</i> mean anything to you? Did one 'protect'
the other?" She replied at once (8 September 1915)
referring me to Horace, <i>Carm</i>. <span class="smcap">II.</span> xvii. 27-30, and
saying:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I perceived therefore, from this manifestly correct interpretation
of the 'Myers' message to me, that the meaning
was that some blow was going to fall, or was likely to
fall, though I didn't know of what kind, and that Myers
would intervene, apparently to protect me from it. So far
as I can recollect my comparatively trivial thoughts on
the subject, I believe that I had some vague idea that the
catastrophe intended was perhaps of a financial rather than
of a personal kind.</p>

<p>The above message reached me near the beginning of
September in Scotland. Raymond was killed near Ypres
on 14 September 1915, and we got the news by telegram
from the War Office on 17 September. A fallen or falling
tree is a frequently used symbol for death; perhaps through
misinterpretation of <i>Eccl.</i> xi, 3. To several other classical
scholars I have since put the question I addressed to Mrs.
Verrall, and they all referred me to Horace, <i>Carm.</i> <span class="smcap">II.</span> xvii.
as the unmistakable reference.
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h4><i>Mr. Bayfield's Criticism</i></h4>

<p>Soon after the event, I informed the Rev. M. A. Bayfield,
ex-headmaster of Eastbourne College, fully of the
facts, as an interesting S.P.R. incident (saying at the same
time that Myers had not been able to 'ward off' the blow);
and he was good enough to send me a careful note in
reply:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Horace does not, in any reference to his escape, say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[ 93]</a></span>
clearly whether the tree struck him, but I have always
thought it did. He says Faunus lightened the blow; he
does not say 'turned it aside.' As bearing on your terrible
loss, the meaning seems to be that the blow would fall but
would not crush; it would be 'lightened' by the assurance,
conveyed afresh to you by a special message from the still
living Myers, that your boy still lives.</p>

<p>"I shall be interested to know what you think of this
interpretation. The 'protect' I take to mean protect from
being overwhelmed by the blow, from losing faith and hope,
as we are all in danger of doing when smitten by some
crushing personal calamity. Many a man when so smitten
has, like Merlin, lain</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem width24">
<div class="stanza">
<p><span style="margin-left: 13em;">'as dead,</span></p>
<p>And lost to life and use and name and fame.'</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That seems to me to give a sufficiently precise application
to the word (on which Myers apparently insists) and to
the whole reference to Horace."</p>

<p>In a postscript he adds the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In <i>Carm.</i> iii. 8, Horace describes himself as <i>prope
funeratus arboris ictu</i>, 'wellnigh killed by a blow from
a tree.' An artist in expression, such as he was, would
not have mentioned any 'blow' if there had been none;
he would have said 'well nigh killed by a falling tree'&mdash;or
the like. It is to be noted that in both passages he
uses the word <i>ictus</i>. And in ii. 13. 11 (the whole ode is
addressed to the tree) he says the man must have been a
fellow steeped in every wickedness 'who planted thee
an accursed lump of wood, a thing meant to fall (this is
the delicate meaning of <i>caducum</i>&mdash;not merely "falling")
on thine undeserving master's head.' Here again the
language implies that he was struck, and struck on the
head.</p>

<p>"Indeed, the escape must have been a narrow one, and
it is to me impossible to believe that Horace would have
been so deeply impressed by the accident if he had not
actually been struck. He refers to it four times:&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:4.6em;"><i>Carm.</i>ii. 13.&mdash;(Ode addressed to the tree&mdash;forty
lines long.)</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left:7.2em;">ii. 17. 27.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[ 94]</a></span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left:7em;">iii. 4. 27.&mdash;(Here he puts the risk he ran on a
parallel with that of the rout at
Philippi, from which he escaped.)</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left:7em;">iii. 8. 8.</span></p>

<p>"I insist on all this as strengthening my interpretation,
and also as strengthening the assignment of the script
to Myers, who would of course be fully alive to all the
points to be found in his reference to Faunus and
Horace&mdash;and, as I have no doubt, believed that Horace
did not escape the actual blow, and that it was a severe
one."<br />
<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>NOTE BY O. J. L.</h3>

<p>Since some of the translators, especially verse translators, of
Horace convey the idea of turning aside or warding off the blow,
it may be well to emphasise the fact that most of the scholars
consulted gave "lightened" or "weakened" as the translation.
And Professor Strong says&mdash;"no doubt at all that 'levasset'
means 'weakened' the blow; the bough fell and struck the
Poet, but lightly, through the action of Faunus. 'Levo' in this
sense is quite common and classical."</p>

<p>Bryce's prose translation (Bohn) is quite clear&mdash;
"a tree-stem falling on my head had surely been my death,
had not good Faunus eased the blow...."</p>

<p>And although Conington's translation
has "check'd the blow in mid descent,"
he really means the same thing, because it is the slaying,
not the wounding or striking of the Poet that is prevented:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem width24">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Me the curst trunk, that smote my skull,</p>
<p>Had slain; but Faunus, strong to shield</p>
<p>The friends of Mercury, check'd the blow</p>
<p>In mid descent."</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Additional Piper Script</span></h3>

<p>Mr. Bayfield also calls my attention to another portion
of Piper Script&mdash;in this case not a trance or semi-trance
sitting, but ordinary automatic writing&mdash;dated 5 August,
which reached me simultaneously with the one already
quoted from, at the beginning of September, and which
he says seems intended to prepare me for some personal
trouble:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Yes. For the moment, Lodge, have faith and wisdom
[? confidence] in all that is highest and best.
Have you all not been profoundly guided and cared
for? Can you answer, 'No'? It is by your faith that
all is well and has been."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[ 95]</a></span></p>

<p>I remember being a little struck by the wording in the
above script, urging me to admit that we&mdash;presumably the
family&mdash;had "been profoundly guided and cared for," and
"that all is well and has been"; because it seemed to indicate
that something was not going to be quite so well. But
it was too indefinite to lead me to make any careful record
of it, or to send it as a prediction to anybody for filing;
and it would no doubt have evaporated from my mind
except for the 'Faunus' warning, given three days later,
though received at the same time, which seemed to me
clearly intended as a prediction, whether it happened to
come off or not.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>The two Piper communications, of which parts have
now been quoted, reached me at Gullane, East Lothian,
where my wife (M. F. A. L.) and I were staying for a few
weeks. They arrived early in September 1915, and as soon
as I had heard from Mrs. Verrall I wrote to Miss Piper to
acknowledge them, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
"<i>The Linga Private Hotel,<br />
Gullane, East Lothian,<br />
12 September 1915</i><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Alta</span>,&mdash;The reference to the Poet and Faunus
in your mother's last script is quite intelligible, and a good classical
allusion. You might tell the 'communicator' some time if there
is opportunity.</p>

<p>"I feel sure that it must convey nothing to you and yours.
That is quite as it should be, as you know, for evidential reasons."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was written two days before Raymond's death,
and five days before we heard of it. The Pipers' ignorance
of any meaning in the Poet and Faunus allusion was
subsequently confirmed.</p>

<p>It so happens that this letter was returned to me, for
some unknown reason, through the Dead Letter Office,
reaching me on 14 November 1915, and being then sent
forward by me again.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap">IT now remains to indicate how far Myers carried out
his implied promise, and what steps he took, or
has been represented as having taken, to lighten the
blow&mdash;which it is permissible to say was a terribly severe
one.</p>

<p>For such evidence I must quote from the record of
sittings held here in England with mediums previously
unknown, and by sitters who gave no sort of clue as to identity.
(See the historical record, beginning at <a href="#Page_117">Chapter V.</a>)</p>

<p>It may be objected that my own general appearance is
known or might be guessed. But that does not apply to
members of my family, who went quite anonymously to
private sittings kindly arranged for by a friend in London
(Mrs. Kennedy, wife of Dr. Kennedy), who was no relation
whatever, but whose own personal experience caused her
to be sympathetic and helpful, and who is both keen and
critical about evidential considerations.</p>

<p>I may state, for what it is worth, that as a matter of
fact normal clues to identity are disliked, and, in so far as
they are gratuitous, are even resented, by a good medium;
for they are no manner of use, and yet subsequently they
appear to spoil evidence. It is practically impossible for
mediums to hunt up and become normally acquainted with
the family history of their numerous sitters, and those who
know them are well aware that they do nothing of the sort,
but in making arrangements for a sitting it is not easy,
unless special precautions are taken, to avoid giving a name
and an address, and thereby appearing to give facilities
for fraud.</p>

<p>In our case, and in that of our immediate friends, these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[ 97]</a></span>
precautions have been taken&mdash;sometimes in a rather elaborate
manner.</p>

<p>The first sitting that was held after Raymond's death
by any member of the family was held not explicitly for
the purpose of getting into communication with him&mdash;still
less with any remotest notion of entering into communication
with Mr. Myers&mdash;but mainly because a French
widow lady, who had been kind to our daughters during
winters in Paris, was staying with my wife at Edgbaston&mdash;her
first real visit to England&mdash;and was in great distress
at the loss of both her beloved sons in the war, within
a week of each other, so that she was left desolate. To
comfort her my wife took her up to London to call on Mrs.
Kennedy, and to get a sitting arranged for with a medium
whom that lady knew and recommended. Two anonymous
interviews were duly held, and incidentally I may say that
the two sons of Madame communicated, on both occasions,
though with difficulty; that one of them gave his name
completely, the other approximately; and that the mother,
who was new to the whole subject, was partially consoled.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Raymond, however, was represented as coming with them
and helping them, and as sending some messages on his own
account. I shall here only quote those messages which bear
upon the subject of <i>Myers</i> and have any possible connexion
with the 'Faunus' message.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Extracts Relating to 'Myers' from Early<br />
Anonymous Sittings</span></h3>

<p>We heard first of Raymond's death on 17 September
1915, and on 25 September his mother (M. F. A. L.), who
was having an anonymous sitting for a friend with Mrs.
Leonard, then a complete stranger, had the following
spelt out by tilts of a table, as purporting to come from
Raymond:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">Tell father I have met some friends of his.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">M. F. A. L.</span>&mdash;Can you give any name?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[ 98]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">Yes. Myers.</span></p>
</div>

<p>(That was all on that subject on that occasion.)</p>

<p>On the 27th of September 1915, I myself went to London
and had my first sitting, between noon and one o'clock,
with Mrs. Leonard. I went to her house or flat alone, as
a complete stranger, for whom an appointment had been
made through Mrs. Kennedy. Before we began, Mrs.
Leonard informed me that her 'guide' or 'control' was a
young girl named "Feda."</p>

<p>In a short time after the medium had gone into trance,
a youth was described in terms which distinctly suggested
Raymond, and "Feda" brought messages. I extract the
following:&mdash;</p>

<h4><i>From First Anonymous Sitting of O. J. L. with<br />
Mrs. Leonard, 27 September 1915</i></h4>

<p class="center">(Mrs. Leonard's control, Feda, supposed to be speaking
throughout.)
</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He finds it difficult, he says, but he has got so many
kind friends helping him. He didn't think when he waked
up first that he was going to be happy, but now he is, and
he says he is going to be happier. He knows that as soon
as he is a little more ready he has got a great deal of work
to do. "I almost wonder," he says, "shall I be fit and able
to do it. They tell me I shall."</p>

<p>"I have instructors and teachers with me." Now he is
trying to build up a letter of some one; M. he shows me.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">(A short time later, he said:&mdash;)</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>"People think I say I am happy in order to make
them happier, but I don't.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>

many who tell me that, a little later, they will explain why they are
helping me. I feel I have got two fathers now. I don't feel I have lost
one and got another; I have got both.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[ 99]</a></span>
I have got my old one, and another too&mdash;a <i>pro tem</i>.
father."</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">(Here Feda ejaculated "What's that? Is that
right?" O. J. L. replied 'Yes.')</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>There is a weight gone off his mind the last day or two;
he feels brighter and lighter and happier altogether, the
last few days. There was confusion at first. He could
not get his bearings, didn't seem to know where he was.
"But I was not very long," he says, "and I think I was
very fortunate; it was not very long before it was explained
to me where I was."</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But the most remarkable indirect allusion, or apparent
allusion, to something like the 'Faunus' message, came at
the end of the sitting, after "Raymond" had gone, and just
before Mrs. Leonard came out of trance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>"He is gone, but Feda sees something which is only
symbolic; she sees a cross falling back on to you; very
dark, falling on to you; dark and heavy looking; and as
it falls it gets twisted round and the other side seems all
light, and the light is shining all over you. It is a sort of
pale blue, but it is white and quite light when it touches
you. Yes, that is what Feda sees. The cross looked dark,
and then it suddenly twisted round and became a beautiful
light. The cross is a means of shedding real light. It is
going to help a great deal.</p>

<p>"Did you know you had a coloured Guide?... He
says your son is the cross of light; he is the cross of light,
and he is going to be a light that will help you; he is
going to help too to prove to the world the Truth. That
is why they built up the dark cross that turned to bright.
You know; but others, they do so want to know. Feda
is loosing hold; good-bye."</p>
</div>

<p class="center">[<i>This ends the O. J. L. first Leonard sitting of<br />
27 September 1915.</i>]</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the same day, 27 September 1915,
that I had this first sitting with Mrs. Leonard, Lady Lodge
had her first sitting, as a complete stranger, with Mr. A.
Vout Peters, who had been invited for the purpose&mdash;without
any name being given&mdash;to Mrs. Kennedy's house at
3.30 p.m.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[ 100]</a></span></p>

<p>Here again, Raymond was described well enough, fairly
early in the sitting, and several identifying messages were
given. Presently 'Moonstone' (Peters's chief control)
asked, "Was he not associated with Chemistry?" As a
matter of fact, my laboratory has been rather specially
chemical of late; and the record continues, copied with
subsequent annotations in square brackets as it stands:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockreply5">

one associated with him was, because I see all the
things in a chemical laboratory.</p>

<p>That chemistry thing takes me away from him to a
man in the flesh [O. J. L. presumably]; and, connected
with him, a man, a writer of poetry, on our
side, closely connected with spiritualism. He was

</div>

<p>At a Leonard Table Sitting on 12 October 1915&mdash;by
which time our identity was known to Mrs. Leonard&mdash;I
told 'Myers' that I understood his Piper message about
Faunus and the Poet; and the only point of interest about
the reply or comment is that the two following sentences
were spelt out, purporting to come either indirectly or
directly from 'Myers':&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>1. He says it meant your son's tr[ansition].</p>

<p>2. Your son shall be mine.</p>

<p>The next 'Myers' reference came on 29 October, when
I had a sitting with Peters, unexpectedly and unknown to
my family, at his London room (15 Devereux Court, Fleet
Street)&mdash;a sitting arranged for by Mr. J. A. Hill for an
anonymous friend:&mdash;</p>

<p>Peters went into trance, and after some other communications,
gave messages from a youth who was recognised
by the control and identified as my son; and later on

<p>Your common-sense method of approaching the subject in the family has been the means of helping

<p><span style="margin-left: -3.5em;"><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Yes, I understand. [Meaning that I recognised
the allusion to F. W. H. Myers's poem <i>St. Paul</i>.]</span></p>

<p>No, your boy laughs, he has got an ulterior motive

you will be able by the strength of your personality
to do what you want to do now, to ride over the
quibbles of the fools, and to make the Society, <i>the</i>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>Now he says, "He helped me because, with me
through you, he can break away the dam that
people have set up. Later on, you are going to
speak to them. It is already on the programme,
and you will break down the opposition because of
me." Then he says, "For God's sake, father, do it.
Because if you only knew, and could only see what
I see: hundreds of men and women heart-broken.
And if you could only see the boys on our side shut
out, you would throw the whole strength of yourself

into this work. But you can do it." He is very
earnest. Oh, and he wants&mdash;No, I must stop him,
I must prevent him, I don't want him to control the
medium.&mdash;Don't think me unkind, but I must protect
my medium; he would not be able to do the
work he has to do; the medium would be ill from it,
I must protect him, the emotion would be too great,
too great for both of you, so I must prevent him
from controlling.</p>

<p>He understands, but he wants me to tell you
this:&mdash;</p>

<p>The feeling on going over was one of intense disappointment,
he had no idea of death. The second
too was grief. (Pause.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a time when men and women have had
the crust broken off them&mdash;a crust of convention,
of ... of indifference, has been smashed, and everybody
thinks, though some selfishly.</p>

<p>Now, returning to him, how patient he is! He
was not always so patient. After the grief there
was a glimmering of hope, because he realised that
he could get back to you; and because his grandmother
came to him. Then his brother was introduced
to him. Then, he says, other people. Myerse&mdash;"Myerse,"
it sounds like&mdash;do you know what

get back. He knew.</p>

<p>Now he wants me to tell you this: That from
his death, which is only one of thousands, that the
work which he (I have to translate his ideas into
words, I don't get them verbatum [<i>sic</i>])&mdash;the work
which he volunteered to be able to succeed in,&mdash;no,
that's not it. The work which he enlisted for, that
is what he says, only he was only a unit and seemingly
lost&mdash;yet the very fact of his death will be
the means of pushing it on. Now I have got it.
By his passing away, many hundreds will be benefited.

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It will be understood, I hope, that the above extracts
from sittings have been reproduced here in order to show
that, if we take the incidents on their face value, Myers
had redeemed his 'Faunus' promise, and had lightened the
blow by looking after and helping my son 'on the other
side.' I now propose to make some further extracts&mdash;of
a more evidential character&mdash;tending to establish the survival
of my son's own personality and memory. There have
been several of these evidential episodes, making strongly
in this direction; but I select, for description here, one
relating to a certain group photograph, of which we were
told through two mediums, but of which we normally knew
nothing till afterwards.</p>

I realise now, though the relevance has only just struck me,
that from the point of view of an outside critic, pardonably suspicious
of bad faith, this episode of the bereaved French lady&mdash;an obviously
complete stranger to Mrs. Kennedy as well as to the medium&mdash;has an
evidential and therefore helpful side.</p>

<span class="small">THE GROUP PHOTOGRAPH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I NOW come to a peculiarly good piece of evidence
arising out of the sittings which from time to time
we held in the autumn of 1915, namely, the mention
and description of a group photograph taken near the Front,
of the existence of which we were in complete ignorance,
but which was afterwards verified in a satisfactory and
complete manner. It is necessary to report the circumstances
rather fully:&mdash;</p>

<p>Raymond was killed on 14 September 1915.</p>

<p>The first reference to a photograph taken of him with
other men was made by Peters at M. F. A. L.'s first sitting
with Peters, in Mrs. Kennedy's house, on 27 September
1915, thus:&mdash;</p>

<h3><i>Extract from M. F. A. L.'s anonymous Sitting with Peters<br />
on 27 September 1915</i></h3>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>"You have several portraits of this boy. Before he
went away you had got a good portrait of him&mdash;two&mdash;no,
three. Two where he is alone and one
where he is in a group of other men. He is particular
that I should tell you of this. In one you
see his walking-stick"&mdash;('Moonstone' here put an
imaginary stick under his arm).</p>
</div>

<p>We had single photographs of him of course, and in
uniform, but we did not know of the existence of a photograph
in which he was one of a group; and M. F. A. L.
was sceptical about it, thinking that it might well be only
a shot or guess on the part of Peters at something
probable. But Mrs. Kennedy (as Note-taker) had written
down most of what was said, and this record was kept,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[ 106]</a></span>
copied, and sent to Mr. Hill in the ordinary course at the
time.</p>

<p>I was myself, moreover, rather impressed with the
emphasis laid on it&mdash;"he is particular that I should tell
you of this"&mdash;and accordingly made a half-hearted inquiry
or two; but nothing more was heard on the subject for
two months. On Monday, 29 November, however, a letter
came from Mrs. Cheves, a stranger to us, mother of Captain
Cheves of the R.A.M.C., who had known Raymond and
had reported to us concerning the nature of his wound,
and who is still doing good work at the Front.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cheves' welcome letter ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
"<i>28 November 1915</i>
<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Lady Lodge</span>,&mdash;My son, who is M.O. to the 2nd South
Lancs, has sent us a group of officers taken in August, and I
wondered whether you knew of this photo and had had a copy.
If not may I send you one, as we have half a dozen and also a
key? I hope you will forgive my writing to ask this, but I have
often thought of you and felt so much for you in yr. great sorrow.</p>

<p class="right">
&mdash;Sincerely yours, <span class="smcap">B. P. Cheves</span>"<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>M. F. A. L. promptly wrote, thanking her, and asking
for it; but fortunately it did not come at once.</p>

<p>Before it came, I (O. J. L.) was having a sitting with
Mrs. Leonard alone at her house on 3 December; and on
this occasion, among other questions, I asked carefully
concerning the photograph, wishing to get more detailed
information about it, before it was seen. It should be
understood that the subject was not introduced by Mrs.
Leonard or her control. The previous mention of a photograph
had been through Peters. It was I that introduced
the subject through Mrs. Leonard, and asked a question;
and the answers were thus reported and recorded at the
time&mdash;the typing out of the sitting being all done before
the photograph arrived:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>At the back he shows me lines going down. It
looks like a black background, with lines at the back
of them. (Feda here kept drawing vertical lines in
the air.)</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>There was, for some reason, considerable delay in the
arrival of the photograph; it did not arrive till the afternoon
of December 7. Meanwhile, on December 6, Lady
Lodge had been looking up Raymond's Diary, which had
been returned from the Front with his kit, and found an
entry:&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:4em;">"<i>24 August.</i>&mdash;Photo taken."</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left:4em;">(A statement will follow to this effect.)</span></p>

<p>Now Raymond had only had one "leave" home since
going to the Front, and this leave was from 16 July to
20 July. The photograph had not been taken then, and
so he could not have told us anything about it. The exposure
was only made twenty-one days before his death,
and some days may have elapsed before he saw a print, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[ 109]</a></span>
he ever saw one. He certainly never mentioned it in his
letters. We were therefore in complete ignorance concerning
it; and only recently had we normally become aware
of its existence.</p>

<p>On the morning of 7 December another note came from
Mrs. Cheves, in answer to a question about the delay; and
this letter said that the photograph was being sent off.
Accordingly I (O. J. L.), thinking that the photograph
might be coming at once, dictated a letter to go to Mr.
Hill, recording roughly my impression of what the photograph
would be like, on the strength of the communication
received by me from 'Raymond' through Mrs. Leonard;
and this was posted by A. E. Briscoe about lunch-time on
the same day. (See statement by Mr. Briscoe at the end.)
My statement to Mr. Hill ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<h3><i>Copy of what was written by O. J. L. to Mr. Hill about the<br />
Photograph on the morning of Tuesday, 7 December 1915</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>"Concerning that photograph which Raymond mentioned
through Peters [saying this: 'One where he is in a group of
other men. He is particular that I should tell you of this. In
one you see his walking-stick,'],<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
he has said some more about it through Mrs. Leonard. But he is doubtful
about the stick. What he says is that there is a considerable number of
men in the photograph; that the front row is sitting, and that there is
a back row, or some of the people grouped and set up at the back; also
that there are a dozen or more people in the photograph, and that some
of them he hardly knew; that a B is prominent in the photograph, and
that there is also a C; that he himself is sitting down, and that there
are people behind him, one of whom either leant on his shoulder, or
tried to.</p>

<p>"The photograph has not come yet, but it may come any
day now; so I send this off before I get it.</p>

<p>"The actual record of what was said in the sitting is being
typed, but the above represents my impression of it."</p>
</blockquote>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>The photograph was delivered at Mariemont between
3 and 4 p.m. on the afternoon of 7 December. It was a
wet afternoon, and the package was received by Rosalynde,
who took the wet wrapper off it. Its size was
12 by 9 inches, and was an enlargement from a 5 by 7
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[ 110]</a></span>
inch original. The number of people in the photograph is
twenty-one, made up as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Five in the front row squatting on the grass, Raymond
being one of these; the second from the right.</p>

<p>Seven in the second row seated upon chairs.</p>

<p>Nine in the back row standing up against the outside
of a temporary wooden structure such as might
be a hospital shed or something
of that kind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On examining the photograph, we found that every
peculiarity mentioned by Raymond, unaided by the
medium, was strikingly correct. The walking-stick is
there (but Peters had put a stick under his arm, which is
not correct), and in connexion with the background Feda
had indicated vertical lines, not only by gesture but by saying
"lines going down," as well as "a black background
with lines at the back of them." There are six conspicuous
nearly vertical lines on the roof of the shed, but the horizontal
lines in the background generally are equally conspicuous.</p>

<p>By "a mixed lot," we understood members of different
Companies&mdash;not all belonging to Raymond's Company, but
a collection from several. This must be correct, as they
are too numerous for one Company. It is probable that
they all belong to one Regiment, except perhaps one whose
cap seems to have a thistle badge instead of three feathers.</p>

<p>As to "prominence," I have asked several people which
member of the group seemed to them the most prominent;
and except as regards central position, a well-lighted standing
figure on the right has usually been pointed to as most
prominent. This one is "B," as stated, namely, Captain
S. T. Boast.</p>

<p>Some of the officers must have been barely known to
Raymond, while some were his friends. Officers whose
names begin with B, with C, and with R were among them;
though not any name beginning with K. The nearest approach
to a K-sound in the group is one beginning with a
hard C.</p>

<p>Some of the group are sitting, while others are standing
behind. Raymond is one of those sitting on the ground
in front, and his walking-stick or regulation cane is lying
across his feet.</p>

<div class="caption">GROUP OF OFFICERS, AS SENT US BY MRS. CHEVES ON<br />
7 DECEMBER, 1915, SHOWING AN ARM RESTING ON<br />RAYMOND'S SHOULDER</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[ 111]</a></span></p>

<p>The background is dark, and is conspicuously lined.</p>

<p>It is out of doors, close in front of a shed or military
hut, pretty much as suggested to me by the statements
made in the 'Leonard' sitting&mdash;what I called a
"shelter."</p>

<p>But by far the most striking piece of evidence is the
fact that some one sitting behind Raymond is leaning or
resting a hand on his shoulder. The photograph fortunately
shows the actual occurrence, and almost indicates
that Raymond was rather annoyed with it; for his face
is a little screwed up, and his head has been slightly bent
to one side out of the way of the man's arm. It is the only
case in the photograph where one man is leaning or resting
his hand on the shoulder of another, and I judge that it is
a thing not unlikely to be remembered by the one to whom
it occurred.</p>

<h3>CONFIRMATORY STATEMENTS</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Statement by Raymond's Mother</span></h4>

<p>Four days ago (6 December), I was looking through my son
Raymond's Diary which had been returned with his kit from the
Front. (The edges are soaked, and some of the leaves stuck
together, with his blood.) I was struck by finding an entry
"Photo taken" under the date 24 August, and I entered the
fact in my own Diary at once, thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

I started for the University, taking that and other letters with
me for posting in town. I went straight to the University, and

and as the paper, wrapping up what I took to be the photograph,
was wet with the rain, I undid it and left the photograph in tissue
paper on a table, having just glanced at it to see if it was the
one we'd been waiting for.</p>

<p>No one saw it or was shown it till after tea, when I showed it
to Mother. That would be about 6. Mrs. Thompson, Lorna, and
Barbara now also saw it. Honor was not at home and did not
see it till later.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Note by O. J. L.</span></h4>

<p>In answer to an inquiry, Messrs. Gale &amp; Polden, of
Aldershot and London, the firm whose name was printed at
the foot of the photograph, informed me that it was "from
a negative of a group of Officers sent to us by Captain
Boast of the 2nd South Lancashire Regiment"; and having
kindly looked up the date, they further tell me that they
received the negative from Captain Boast on 15 October
1915.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that information about the existence
of the photograph came through Peters on 27 September&mdash;more
than a fortnight, therefore, before the negative
reached England.</p>

<p>The photograph is only shown here because of its evidential
interest. Considered as a likeness of Raymond, it
is an exceptionally bad one; he appears shrunk into an
uncomfortable position.</p>

<h4><i>Extract from a letter by Captain Boast from the Trenches,<br />
dated 7 May 1916, to Mrs. Case, and lent me to see</i></h4>

<blockquote>
<p>"Some months ago (last summer) the Officers of our
Battalion had their photo taken.... You see, the photographer
who took us was a man who had been shelled out
of house and home, and as he had no means of doing the
photos for us, we bought the negatives, and sent them along
to be finished in England."</p>

<h4><i>A later Letter from Captain Boast</i></h4>

<p>In answer to a special inquiry addressed to Captain
Boast at the Front, he has been good enough to favour me
with the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">"<i>10 July 1916</i><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your letter of 4 July has just reached
me. The proofs of the photographs referred to were
received by me from the photographer at Reninghelst two
or three days after being taken. To the best of my belief,
your son saw the proofs, but I cannot now say positively.
I obtained particulars of requirements from the officers
forming the group, but the photographer then found he
was unable to obtain paper for printing. I therefore bought
the negatives and sent them home to Gale &amp; Polden. In
view of the fact that your son did not go back to the
trenches till 12 September 1915, it is highly probable that
he saw the proofs, but he certainly did not see the negatives.&mdash;Yours
faithfully,</p>

<p class="right">
"(Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Sydney T. Boast</span>"<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It thus appears that Raymond had probably seen a
proof of the photograph, but that there were no copies
or prints available. Consequently neither we, nor any
other people at home, could have received them; and the
negatives were only received in England by Gale &amp; Polden
on 15 October 1915, after Peters had mentioned the
existence of the photograph, which he did on 27 September
1915.</p>

<p>I obtained from Messrs. Gale &amp; Polden prints of all
the accessible photographs which had been taken at the
same time. The size of these prints was 5 by 7 inches.</p>

<p>I found that the group had been repeated, with slight
variations, three times&mdash;the Officers all in the same relative
positions, but not in identically the same attitudes.
One of the three prints is the same as the one we had seen,
with some one's hand resting on Raymond's shoulder, and
Raymond's head leaning a little on one side, as if rather
annoyed. In another the hand had been removed, being
supported by the owner's stick; and in that one Raymond's
head is upright. This corresponds to his uncertainty as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[ 114]</a></span>
to whether he was actually taken with the man leaning on
him or not. In the third, however, the sitting officer's leg
rests against Raymond's shoulder as he squats in front,
and the slant of the head and slight look of annoyance have
returned.</p>

<p>These two additional photographs are here reproduced.
Their merit is in showing that the leaning on him, mentioned
by 'Raymond' through Feda, was well marked, and
yet that he was quite right in being uncertain whether
he was actually being leant on while the photograph was
being taken. The fact turns out to be that during two
exposures he was being leaned on, and during one exposure
he was not. It was, so to speak, lucky that the
edition sent us happened to show in one form the actual
leaning.</p>

<p>I have since discovered what is apparently the only
other photograph of Officers in which Raymond occurs,
but it is quite a different one, and none of the description
applies to it. For it is completely in the open air, and
Raymond is standing up in the hinder of two rows. He is
second from the left, the tall one in the middle is his friend
Lieutenant Case, and standing next him is Mr. Ventris
(see p.<a href="#Page_279"> 279</a>). It is fortunate again that this photograph
did not happen to be the one sent us; for we should have
considered the description hopelessly wrong.

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Concluding Note by O. J. L.</span></h4>

<p>As to the evidential value of the whole communication,
it will be observed that there is something of the nature
of cross-correspondence, of a simple kind, in the fact that
a reference to the photograph was made through one
medium, and a description given, in answer to a question,
through another independent one.</p>

<p>The episode is to be published in the <i>Proceedings</i> of the
S.P.R. for 1916, and a few further facts or comments are
there added.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i_139"></a>
<img src="images/i_139.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption">GROUP SUBSEQUENTLY OBTAINED, EVIDENTLY TAKEN AT<br />
THE SAME TIME, BUT PRESSURE ON SHOULDER REMOVED
</div>
</div>

<p>The elimination of ordinary telepathy from the living,
except under the far-fetched hypothesis of the unconscious
influence of complete strangers, was exceptionally complete;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[ 115]</a></span>
inasmuch as the whole of the information was
recorded before any of us had seen the photograph.</p>

<p>Even the establishment of a date in August for the
taking of the photograph, as mentioned first in Mrs. Cheves'
letter and confirmed by finding an entry in Raymond's
Diary, is important, because the last time we ever saw
Raymond was in July.</p>

<p>To my mind the whole incident is rather exceptionally
good as a piece of evidence; and that 'Raymond' expected
it to be good evidence is plain from Peters's ('Moonstone's')
statement, at that first reference to a photograph on 27
September, namely, "He is particular that I should tell
you of this." (This sentence it probably was which made
me look out for such a photograph, and take pains to get
records soundly made beforehand.) Our complete ignorance,
even of the existence of the photograph, in the first
place, and secondly the delayed manner in which knowledge
of it normally came to us, so that we were able to make
provision for getting the supernormally acquired details
definitely noted beforehand, seem to me to make it a first-class
case. While, as to the amount of coincidence between
the description and the actual photograph, that surely is
quite beyond chance or guesswork. For not only are many
things right, but practically nothing is wrong.

<h2><span class="gesperrt">CHAPTER V</span><br />
<span class="small">BEGINNING OF HISTORICAL RECORD OF<br />
SITTINGS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Although this episode of the photograph is a
good and evidential one, I should be sorry to base
an important conclusion on any one piece of evidence,
however cogent. All proofs are really cumulative;
and though it is legitimate to emphasise anything like a
crucial instance, it always needs supplementing by many
others, lest there may have been some oversight. Accordingly,
I now proceed to quote from sittings held by members
of the family after Raymond's death&mdash;laying stress
upon those which were arranged for, and held throughout,
in an anonymous manner, so that there was not the slightest
normal clue to identity.</p>

<p>The first message came to us through a recent friend
of ours in London, Mrs. Kennedy, who herself has the
power of automatic writing, and who, having lost her
specially beloved son Paul, has had her hand frequently
controlled by him&mdash;usually only so as to give affectionate
messages, but sometimes in a moderately evidential way.
She had been sceptical about the genuineness of this power
apparently possessed by herself; and it was her painful
uncertainty on this point that had brought her into correspondence
with me, for she was trying to test her own
writing in various ways, as she was so anxious not to be
deceived. The first I ever heard of her was the following
letter which came while I was in Australia, and was dealt
with by Mr. Hill:&mdash;
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h3>FIRST LETTER FROM MRS. KENNEDY TO O. J. L.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
"<i>16 August 1914</i><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir Oliver Lodge.</span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Because of your investigations into spirit life,
I venture to ask your help.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[ 118]</a></span></p>

<p>"My only son died 23 June, eight weeks after a terrible
accident. On 25 June (without my asking for it or having
thought of it) I felt obliged to hold a pencil, and I received in
automatic writing his name and 'yes' and 'no' in answer to
questions.</p>

<p>"Since then I have had several pages of writing from him
every day and sometimes twice daily. I say 'from him'; the whole
torturing question is&mdash;is it from him or am I self-deceived?</p>

<p>"My knowledge is infinitesimal. Nineteen years ago a sister
who had died the year before suddenly used my hand, and after
that wrote short messages at intervals; another sister a year
later, and my father one message sixteen years ago; but I felt so
self-deceived that I always pushed it aside, until it came back
to me, unasked, after my son's passing over.</p>

<p>"Your knowledge is what I appeal to, and the deep, personal
respect one has for you and your investigations. It is for my
son's sake&mdash;he is only seventeen&mdash;and he writes with such intense
sadness of my lack of decided belief that I venture to beg help
of a stranger in a matter so sacred to me.</p>

<p>"Do you ever come to London, and, if so, could you possibly
allow me to see you for even half an hour? and you might judge
from the strange and holy revelations (I know no other way to
express many of the messages that are sent) whether they can
possibly be only from my own subconscious mind.... Pardon
this length of letter.&mdash;Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="right">
"(Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Katherine Kennedy</span>"<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ultimately I was able to take her anonymously and
unexpectedly to an American medium, Mrs. Wriedt, and
there she received strong and unmistakable proofs.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> She
also received excellent confirmation through several
other mediums whom she had discovered for herself&mdash;notably
Mr. Vout Peters and Mrs. Osborne Leonard.
Of Mrs. Leonard I had not previously heard; I had heard
of a Madame St. Leonard, or some name like that,
but this is somebody else. Mrs. Kennedy tells me
that she herself had not known Mrs. Leonard long,
her own first sitting with that lady having been on
14 September 1915. I must emphasise the fact that
Mrs. Kennedy is keen and careful about evidential considerations.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Kennedy's son Paul plays a part in what

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[ 119]</a></span>

follows, perhaps it is permissible to quote here a description
of him which she gave to Mr. Hill in October 1914,
accompanying an expression of surprise at the serious messages
which she sometimes received from him&mdash;interspersed
with his fun and his affection:&mdash;</p>

<h3>K. K.'s DESCRIPTION OF PAUL</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>"Picture to yourself this boy: not quite eighteen but always
taken for twenty or twenty-two; an almost divine character
underneath, but exteriorly a typical 'motor knut,' driving racing-cars
at Brooklands, riding for the Jarrott Cup on a motor cycle,
and flying at Hendon as an Air Mechanic; dining out perpetually,
because of his charm which made him almost besieged by friends;
and apparently without any creed except honour, generosity, love
of children, the bringing home of every stray cat to be fed here
and comforted, a total disregard of social distinctions when choosing
his friends, and a hatred of hurting anyone's feelings."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On seeing the announcement of Mr. R. Lodge's death
in a newspaper, Mrs. Kennedy 'spoke' to Paul about it,
and asked him to help; she also asked for a special sitting
with Mrs. Leonard for the same purpose, though without
saying why. The name Raymond was on that occasion
spelt out through the medium, and he was said to be
sleeping. This was on 18 September. On the 21st,
while Mrs. Kennedy was writing in her garden on ordinary
affairs, her own hand suddenly wrote, as from her son
Paul:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>"I am here.... I have seen that boy Sir Oliver's
son; he's better, and has had a splendid rest, tell his
people."</p>
</div>

<p>Lady Lodge having been told about Mrs. Leonard, and
wanting to help a widowed French lady, Madame Le
Breton, who had lost both her sons, and was on a visit to
England, asked Mrs. Kennedy to arrange a sitting, so as
to avoid giving any name. A sitting was accordingly
arranged with Mrs. Leonard for 24 September 1915.</p>

<p>On 22 September, Mrs. Kennedy, while having what
she called a 'talk' with Paul, suddenly wrote automatically:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>"I shall bring Raymond to his father when he comes
to see you.... He is so jolly, every one loves him;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[ 120]</a></span>
he has found heaps of his own folks here,and he is settling
down wonderfully. <span class="smcap">Do tell his father and
mother</span>.... He spoke clearly to-day.... He doesn't fight
like the others, he seems so settled already. It is a ripping
thing to see one boy like this. He has been sleeping a long
time, but he has spoken to-day....</p>

<p>"If you people only knew how we long to come, they
would all call us."</p>
</div>

<p><span style="margin-left:3em;">[Capitals indicate large and emphatic writing.]</span></p>

<p>On the 23rd, during Lady Lodge's call, Mrs. Kennedy's
hand wrote what purported to be a brief message from
Raymond, thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>"I am here, mother.... I have been to Alec already,
but he can't hear me. I do wish he would believe that we are here safe; it isn't a dismal hole like
people think, it is a place where there is life."</p>
</div>

<p>And again:</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>"Wait till I have learned better how to speak like
this.... We can express all we want later; give
me time."</p>
</div>

<p>I need hardly say that there is nothing in the least
evidential in all this. I quote it only for the sake of
reasonable completeness, so as to give the history from the
beginning. Evidence comes later.</p>

<p>Next day, 24 September 1915, the ladies went for an
interview with Mrs. Leonard, who knew no more than that
friends of Mrs. Kennedy would accompany her. The
following is Lady Lodge's account of the sitting:&mdash;</p>

<h3><i>First Sitting of any Member of the Family (Anonymous)<br />
with Mrs. Leonard</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smaller">GENERAL ACCOUNT BY M. F. A. L.</span><br />
<span class="smcap"><span class="smaller">24 September 1915</span></span></h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Leonard went into a sort of trance, I suppose, and came
back as a little Indian girl called 'Freda,' or 'Feda,' rubbing her
hands, and talking in the silly way they do.</p>

<p>However, she soon said there was an old gentleman and a
young one present, whom she described; and Mrs. Kennedy told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[ 121]</a></span>
me afterwards that they were her father and her son Paul. There
seemed to be many others standing beside us, so 'Feda' said.</p>

<p>Then Feda described some one brought in lying down&mdash;about
twenty-four or twenty-five, not yet able to sit up; the features
she described might quite well have belonged to Raymond. (I
forgot to say Mrs. Leonard did not know me or my name, or
Madame le Breton's.) Feda soon said she saw a large R beside
this young man, then an A, then she got a long letter with a tail,
which she could not make out, then she drew an M in the air,
but forgot to mention it, and she said an O came next, and she
said there was another O with a long stroke to it, and finally, she
said she heard 'Yaymond' (which is only her way of pronouncing
it). [The name was presumably got from 'Paul.'&mdash;O. J. L.] Then
she said that he just seemed to open his eyes and smile; and then
he had a choking feeling, which distressed me very much; but
he said he hadn't suffered much&mdash;not nearly as much as I should
think; whether he said this, or Paul, I forget; but Paul asked
me not to tell him to-morrow night that I was not with him, as he
had so much the feeling that I was with him when he died, that
he (Paul) wouldn't like to undeceive him.</p>

<p>I then asked that some one in that other world might kiss
him for me, and a lady, whom they described in a way which was
just like my mother, came and kissed him, and said she was
taking care of him. And there was also an old gentleman, full
white beard, etc. (evidently my stepfather, but Feda said with a
moustache, which was a mistake), with W. up beside him, also
taking care; said he had met Raymond, and he was looking after
him, and lots of others too; but said he [W.] belonged to me and
to 'O.' [Correct.] I asked how and what it was he had done
for me, and Feda made a movement with her fingers, as though
disentangling something, and then putting it into straight lines.
He then said he had made things easier for me. So I said that
was right, and thanked him gratefully. I said also that if Raymond
was in his and Mamma's hands, I was satisfied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[I do not append the notes of this sitting, since it was
held mainly for Madame and her two sons, both of whom
were described, and from whom some messages appeared
to come.]
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h4><i>Table Sitting at Mrs. Leonard's</i></h4>

<p>Next day (Saturday, 25 September 1915), as arranged
partly by Paul, the three ladies went to Mrs. Leonard's
house again for a sitting with a table, and Dr. Kennedy
kindly accompanied them to take notes.</p>

<p>The three ladies and the medium sat round a small
table, with their hands lightly on it, and it tilted in the
usual way. The plan adopted here is for the table to tilt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[ 122]</a></span>
as each letter of the alphabet is spoken by the medium,
and to stop, or 'hold,' when a right letter is reached.
For general remarks on the rationale, or what most people
will naturally consider the absurdity, of intelligent movements
of this kind, see <a href="#Page_362">Chapter XIV, Part III.</a></p>

<p>It was a rather complicated sitting, as it was mainly
for Madame who was a novice in the subject. Towards the
end unfortunately, though momentarily and not at all
pronouncedly, she spoke to Lady Lodge by name. At
these table sittings the medium, Mrs. Leonard, is not unconscious;
accordingly she heard it in her normal self, and
afterwards said that she had heard it. The following
extracts from the early part of the sitting may be
quoted here, as answers purporting to be spelt out by
Raymond:&mdash;</p>

<h4><i>Automatic Writing by Mrs. Kennedy, 26 September</i></h4>

<p>On 26 September Mrs. Kennedy (alone) had a lot of
automatic writing, with her own hand, mainly from Paul,
who presently wrote, "Mother, I have been let to bring
Raymond."</p>

<p>(After a welcome, Raymond was represented as sending
this message:&mdash;)</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>"I can speak easier than I could at the table, because
you are helping all the time. It is easy when we are alone
with you, but if I go there it confuses me a little.... I
long to comfort them. Will you tell them that Raymond
had been to you, and that Paul tells me I can come to you
whenever I like? It is so good of you to let the boys all
come...."</p>

<p>"Paul tells me he has been here since he was seventeen;
he is a jolly chap; every one seems fond of him. I don't
wonder, for he helps every one. It seems a rule to call Paul
if you get in a fix."</p>
</div>

<p>(Then Paul said he was back, and wrote:&mdash;)</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>"He is quite happy really since he finds he can get to
his people. He has slept ever since last night, till I was
told to fetch him to-night."</p>
</div>

<p>(Asked about the French boys, Paul said:&mdash;)</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>"I saw them when I brought them, but I don't see
them otherwise; they are older than I am ... they hardly
believe it yet that they have spoken. All the time they
felt it was impossible, and they nearly gave it up, but I
kept on begging them to tell their mother they lived."</p>

<p>"I do hope she felt it true, mother...."</p>

<p>"It is hard to think your sons are dead; but such a lot
of people do think it. It is revolting to hear the boys tell
you how no one speaks to them ever; it hurts me through
and through."</p>
</div>

<p>(Interval. Paul fetched Guy [one of Madame Le
Breton's sons], saying:&mdash;)</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>"I can't stand it when they call out for help. Speak
to him please, mother."</p>
</div>

<p>(Mrs. Kennedy spoke to Guy, saying that she felt he
could not believe any of it, but would he give time and
trouble to studying the subject as she was doing? The
following writing came:&mdash;)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[ 124]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">Guy.</span>&mdash;I think you hear me because it is just as I am feeling;
how <span class="smcap">CAN</span> I believe we can speak to you who
live where we once lived? It was not possible then
for us to speak to dead people; and why should it
be possible for us to speak. Will you keep on helping
me, please, for I can't follow it, and I long to?
</p>
</div>

<p>(Mrs. Kennedy asked him to ask Paul, that being an
easier method, probably, than getting information through
her. She asked him to 'excuse' Paul's youth.)</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">Guy.</span>&mdash;I like Paul; he is good to us. I shall be glad to talk
to him constantly if he has time for all of us; he
seems a sort of messenger between us and you,
isn't he?</p>
</div>

<p>[Guy had been to school in England, his brother had
not.]</p>

I think it only fair to mention the names of professional
mediums, if I find them at all genuine. I do not guarantee their
efficiency, for mediumship is not a power that can always be depended
on,&mdash;it is liable to vary; sitters also may be incompetent, and
conditions may be bad. The circumstances under which sensitives work
are difficult at the present time and ought to be improved.</p>

<span class="small">FIRST SITTING OF O. J. L. WITH MRS. LEONARD</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON 27 September, as already stated in Chapter III,
I myself visited Mrs. Leonard, going anonymously
and alone, and giving no information beyond the
fact that I was a friend of Mrs. Kennedy. I lay no stress,
on my anonymity, however.</p>

<p>In a short time Feda controlled, and at first described
an elderly gentleman as present. Then she said he brought
some one with the letter R; and as I took verbatim notes
I propose to reproduce this portion in full, so as to give
the general flavour of a 'Feda' sitting; only omitting
what has already been extracted and quoted in <a href="#Page_93">Chapter
III.</a>
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h3><i>O. J. L. at Mrs. Leonard's, Monday, 27 September 1915,
12 noon to 1 o'clock</i></h3>

<p class="center">(Mrs. Leonard's control 'Feda' speaking all the time.)
<br />
<br />
</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>There is some one here with a little difficulty; not fully
built up; youngish looking; form more like an outline;
he has not completely learnt how to build up as yet. Is a
young man, rather above the medium height; rather well-built,
not thick-set or heavy, but well-built. He holds himself
up well. He has not been over long. His hair is between
colours. He is not easy to describe, because he is not
building himself up so solid as some do. He has greyish
eyes; hair brown, short at the sides; a fine-shaped head;
eyebrows also brown, not much arched; nice-shaped nose,
fairly straight, broader at the nostrils a little; a nice-shaped
mouth, a good-sized mouth it is, but it does not
look large because he holds the lips nicely together; chin
not heavy; face oval. He is not built up quite clearly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[ 126]</a></span>
but it feels as if Feda knew him. He must have been here
waiting for you. Now he looks at Feda and smiles; now
he laughs, he is having a joke with Feda, and Paulie laughs
too. Paul says he has been here before, and that Paul
brought him. But Feda sees many hundreds of people,
but they tell me this one has been brought quite lately.
Yes, I have seen him before. Feda remembers a letter
with him too. R, that is to do with him.</p>

<p>(Then Feda murmured, as if to herself, "Try and give
me another letter.") (Pause.)</p>

<p>It is a funny name, not Robert or Richard. He is not
giving the rest of it, but says R again; it is from him.
He wants to know where his mother is; he is looking for
her; he does not understand why she is not here.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -3.5em;"><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Tell him he will see her this afternoon, and that
she is not here this morning, because she wants to
meet him this afternoon at three o'clock.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[Meaning through another medium, namely
Peters. But that, of course, was not said.]</span>
</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He has been to see you before, and he says that
once he thought you knew he was there, and that
two or three times he was not quite sure. Feda
gets it mostly by impression; it is not always what
he says, but what she gets; but Feda says "he says,"
because she gets it from him somehow.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> He finds
it difficult, he says, but he has got so many kind
friends helping him. He didn't think when he waked
up first that he was going to be happy, but now
he is, and he says he is going to be happier. He
knows that as soon as he is a little more ready, he has
got a great deal of work to do. "I almost wonder,"
he says, "shall I be fit and able to do it. They tell
me I shall."</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[<i>And so on as reported in <a href="#Page_73">Chapter III.</a></i>]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He seems to know what the work is. The first
work he will have to do, will be helping at the
Front; not the wounded so much, but helping those
who are passing over in the war. He knows that
when they pass on and wake up, they still feel a
certain fear&mdash;and some other word which Feda
missed. Feda hears a something and 'fear.' Some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[ 127]</a></span>
even go on fighting; at least they want to;
they don't believe they have passed on. So
that many are wanted where he is now, to
explain to them and help them, and soothe them.
They do not know where they are, nor why they are
there.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[I considered that this was ordinary 'Feda talk,'
such as it is probably customary to get
through mediums at this time; therefore, though the
statements are likely enough, there
is nothing new in them, and I thought
it better to interrupt by asking a question. So
I said:&mdash;]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -3.5em;"><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Does he want to send a message to anyone at
home? Or will he give the name of one of his
instructors?</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[I admit that it is stupid thus to ask two questions
at once.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He shows me a capital H, and says that is not
an instructor, it is some one he knows on the earth
side. He wants them to be sure that he is all right
and happy. He says, "People think I say I am happy
in order to make them happier, but I don't".</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[<i>And so on as already reported in <a href="#Page_73">Chapter III.</a></i>]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Now the first gentleman with the letter W is
going over to him and putting his arm round his
shoulder, and he is putting his arm round the gentleman's
back. Feda feels like a string round
her head; a tight feeling in the head, and also an
empty sort of feeling in the chest, empty, as if sort
of something gone. A feeling like a sort of vacant
feeling there; also a bursting sensation in the
head. But he does not know he is giving this.
He has not done it on purpose, they have tried to
make him forget all that, but Feda gets it from him.
There is a noise with it too, an awful noise and a
rushing noise.</p>

<p>He has lost all that now, but he does not seem
to know why Feda feels it now. "I feel splendid,"
he says, "I feel splendid! But I was worried at
first. I was worried, for I was wanting to make it
clear to those left behind that I was all right, and
that they were not to worry about me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[ 128]</a></span></p>

<p>You may think it strange, but he felt that you
would not worry so much as some one else; two
others, two ladies, Feda thinks. You would know,
he says, but two ladies would worry and be uncertain;
but now he believes they know more.</p>
</div>

<p>Then, before Mrs. Leonard came out of trance, came the
description of a falling dark cross which twisted round and
became bright, as reported in <a href="#Page_96">Chapter III.</a></p>

<p>After the sitting, and before I went away, I asked Mrs.
Leonard if she knew who I was. She replied, "Are you
by chance connected with those two ladies who came on
Saturday night?" On my assenting, Mrs. Leonard added,
"Oh! then I know, because the French lady gave the name
away; she said 'Lady Lodge' in the middle of a French
sentence."</p>

<p>I also spoke to her about not having too many sittings
and straining her power. She said she "preferred not to
have more than two or three a day, though sometimes she
could not avoid it; and some days she had to take a
complete rest." But she admitted that she was going to
have another one that day at two o'clock. I told her that
three per day was rather much. She pleaded that there
are so many people who want help now, that she declined
all those who came for only commercial or fortune-telling
motives, but that she felt bound to help those who are distressed
by the war. I report this to show that she saw many
people totally disconnected with Raymond or his family: so
that what she might say to a new unknown member of the
family could be quite evidential.</p>

<h2><span class="gesperrt">CHAPTER VII</span><br />
<span class="small">FIRST PETERS SITTING (ANONYMOUS)</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MRS.KENNEDY desired Lady Lodge to try with a
different and independent medium, and therefore
kindly arranged with Mr. A. Vout Peters to come
to her house on Monday afternoon and give a trance sitting
to 'a friend of hers' not specified. Accordingly,
at or about 3 p.m. on Monday, 27 September 1915, Lady
Lodge went by herself to Mrs. Kennedy's house, so as not
to have to give any name, and awaited the arrival of
Peters, who, when he came, said he would prefer to sit in
Mrs. Kennedy's own room in which he had sat before, and
which he associated with her son Paul. No kind of introduction
was made, and Peters was a total stranger to
Lady Lodge; though to Mrs. Kennedy he was fairly well
known, having several times given her first-rate evidence
about her son, who had proved his identity in several striking
ways.</p>

<p>When Peters goes into a trance his personality is supposed
to change to that of another man, who, we
understand, is called 'Moonstone'; much as Mrs. Piper
was controlled by apparent personalities calling themselves
'Phinuit' or 'Rector.' When Peters does not go
into a trance he has some clairvoyant faculty of his
own.</p>

<p>The only other person present on this occasion was
Mrs. Kennedy, who kindly took notes.</p>

<p>This is an important sitting, as it was held for a complete
stranger, so I propose to report it practically
in full.

</p>

<p>While only partially under control, Peters said: "I feel
a lot of force here, Mrs. Kennedy."</p>

<p>Peters was controlled quickly by 'Moonstone,' who
greeted K. K. and reminded her of a prophecy of his. (This
prophecy related to the Russian place Dvinsk, and to the
important actions likely to be going on there&mdash;as if the
decisive battle of the war was to be fought there.) Then
he turned to L. L. and said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>What a useful life you have led, and will lead.</p>

<p>You have always been the prop of things.</p>

<p>You have always been associated with men a lot.</p>

<p>You are the mother and house prop.</p>

<p>You are not unacquainted with spiritualism.</p>

<p>You have been associated with it more or less for some
time.</p>

<p>I sense you as living away from London&mdash;in the North
or North-West.</p>

<p>You are much associated with men, and you are the
house prop&mdash;the mother. You have no word in the
language that quite gives it&mdash;there are always four
walls, but something more is needed&mdash;you are the house
prop.</p>

<p>You have had a tremendous lot of sadness recently, from
a death that has come suddenly.</p>

<p>You never thought it was to be like this. (Peters went
on talking glibly, and there was no need for the sitter
to say anything.)</p>

<p>There is a gentleman here who is on the other side&mdash;he
went very suddenly. Fairly tall, rather broad, upright
(here the medium sat up very straight and squared his
shoulders)&mdash;rather long face, fairly long nose, lips full,
moustache, nice teeth, quick and active, strong sense of
humour&mdash;he could always laugh, keen sense of affection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[ 131]</a></span></p>

<p>He went over into the spirit world very quickly. There
is no idea of death because it was so sudden, with no
illness.</p>

<p>Do you know anything connected with the letter L?
(No answer was given to this.)</p>

<p>What I am going to say now is from Paul&mdash;he says:
"Tell mother it is not one L, it is double L." He says:
"Tell mother she always loved a riddle"&mdash;he laughs.
(L. L. and K. K. both said they could not understand.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
'Moonstone' continued:&mdash;)</p>

<p>They don't want to make it too easy for you, and
funnily enough, the easier it seems to you sometimes the
more difficult it seems to them.</p>

<p>This man is a soldier&mdash;an officer. He went over where
it is warm.</p>

<p>You are his mother, aren't you&mdash;and he does not call you
ma, or mamma, or mater&mdash;just mother, mother.
[True.]</p>

<p>He is reticent and yet he told you a tremendous lot.</p>

<p>You were not only his mother but his friend.</p>

<p>Wasn't he clever with books? He laughs and says:
"Anyhow I ought to be, I was brought up with them."
He was not altogether a booky person.</p>

<p>He knew of spiritualism before he passed over, but he
was a little bit sceptical&mdash;he had an attitude of carefulness
about it. He tells me to tell you this:</p>

<p>The attitude of Mr. Stead and some of those people
turned him aside; on one side there was too much
credulity&mdash;on the other side too much piffling at
trifles.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[See also Appendix to this sitting.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He holds up in his hand a little heap of olives, as a
symbol for you&mdash;then he laughs. Now he says&mdash;for
a test&mdash;Associated with the olives is the word Roland.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
All of this is to give you proof that he is here.</p>

<p>Before you came you were very down in the dumps.</p>

<p>Was he ill three weeks after he was hurt? [More like
three hours, probably less.]</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">(Various other guesses were made for the meaning of 3.)</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>I see the figure 3 so plainly&mdash;can't you find a meaning
for it?</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">(L. L. suggested 3rd Battalion, and 'Moonstone' continued:&mdash;)</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He says "Yes"&mdash;and wasn't he officially put down on
another one? [Perfectly true, he was attached to the
2nd Battalion at the Front, to the 3rd or reserve Battalion
while training.]<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>He says: "Don't forget to tell father all this."</p>

<p>His home is associated with books&mdash;both reading and
writing books. Wait a minute, he wants to give me a
word, he is a little impatient with me. Manuscripts, he
says, manuscripts&mdash;that's the word.</p>

<p>He sends a message, and he says&mdash;this is more for father&mdash;"It
is no good his attempting to come to the medium
here, he will simply frighten the medium for all he is
worth, and he will not get anything. But he is not
afraid of you, and if there is communication wanted
with this man again, <i>you</i> must come."</p>

<p>You have several portraits of this boy. Before he went
away you had got a good portrait of him&mdash;2&mdash;no, 3.

what he was driving at, partly because the recorder
found it difficult to follow; and though the confusion was
subsequently disentangled through another medium next

<h2><span class="gesperrt">CHAPTER VIII</span><br />
<span class="small">A TABLE SITTING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON 28 September my wife and I together had a
table sitting with Mrs. Leonard, which may be
reported nearly in full together with my preliminary
note written immediately afterwards. This is done not
because it is a particularly good specimen, but because
these early sittings have an importance of their own, and
because it may be instructive to others to see the general
manner of a table sitting. It was, I think, the first joint-sitting
of any kind which we had had since the old Piper
days.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Note by O. J. L. on Table Tiltings</span></h3>

<p>A table sitting is not good for conversation, but it is
useful for getting definite brief answers&mdash;such as names
and incidents, since it seems to be less interfered with by
the mental activity of an intervening medium, and to be
rather more direct. But it has difficulties of its own. The
tilting of the table need not be regarded as a 'physical phenomenon'
in the technical or supernormal sense, yet it does
not <i>appear</i> to be done by the muscles of those present. The
effort required to tilt the table is slight, and evidentially it
must, no doubt, be assumed that so far as mechanical force
is concerned, it is exerted by muscular action. But my
impression is that the tilting is an incipient physical phenomenon,
and that though the energy, of course, comes from
the people present, it does not appear to be applied in quite
a normal way <a href="#Page_362">(XIV, Pt. III).</a></p>

<p>As regards evidence, however, the issue must be limited
to intelligent direction of the energy. All that can safely
be claimed is that the energy is intelligently directed, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[ 138]</a></span>
the self-stoppage of the table at the right letter conveys
by touch a sort of withholding feeling&mdash;a kind of sensation
as of inhibition&mdash;to those whose hands lie flat on the top
of the table. The light was always quite sufficient to see
all the hands, and it works quite well in full daylight.
The usual method is for the alphabet to be called over,
and for the table to tilt or thump at each letter, till it stops
at the right one. The table tilts three times to indicate
"yes," and once to indicate "no"; but as one tilt also represents
the letter A of the alphabet, an error of interpretation
is occasionally made by the sitters. So also C might perhaps
be mistaken for "yes," or <i>vice versa</i>; but that mistake is not
so likely.</p>

<p>Unconscious guidance can hardly be excluded, <i>i.e.</i> cannot
be excluded with any certainty when the answer is of
a kind expected. But first, our desire was rather in the
direction of avoiding such control; and second, the stoppages
were sometimes at unexpected places; and third, a
long succession of letters soon becomes meaningless, except
to the recorder who is writing them down silently,
as they are called out to him <i>seriatim</i>, in another part of
the room.</p>

<p>It will also be observed that at a table sitting it is natural
for the sitters to do most of the talking, and that their object
is to get definite and not verbose replies.</p>

<p>On this occasion the control of the table seemed to
improve as the sitting went on, owing presumably to increased
practice on the part of the communicator, until
towards the end, when there seemed to be some signs of
weariness or incipient exhaustion; and, since the sitting
lasted an hour and a half, tiredness is in no way surprising.</p>

<p>No further attempt was made to keep our identity
from Mrs. Leonard: our name had been given away, as
reported near the end of <a href="#Page_125">Chapter VI</a>.</p>

<h3><i>Table Sitting with Mrs. Leonard, Tuesday, 28 September<br />
1915, at 5.30 p.m.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Present</i>&mdash;O. J. L., M. F. A. L., K. K., with <span class="smcap">Dr. Kennedy
at another Table As Recorder</span></p>

<p>A small partly wicker table with a square top was used, about
18 inches square. O. J. L. and M. F. A. L. sat opposite to each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[ 139]</a></span>
other; K. K. and Mrs. Leonard occupied the other positions,
Mrs. Leonard to the right of O. J. L. After four minutes' interval,
the table began to tilt.</p>

<p><i>Medium.</i>&mdash;Will you tilt three times to show you understand?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>(It did.)</p>
</div>

<p><i>Medium.</i>&mdash;Will you like to give your name?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">(It gave three tilts indicating Yes.)</span></p>
</div>

<p><i>Medium.</i>&mdash;Very well, then, the alphabet. Spell it, please.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">(Mrs. Leonard here repeated the alphabet fairly quickly,
while the table tilted slightly at each letter as it was said,</span></p>
</div>

<p><span style="margin-left: 11.6em;">stopping first at the letter P</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15.2em;">then at the letter A</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">then U</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">then L.</span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -3.5em;">O. J. L.&mdash;Yes, very well, Paul; we know who you are, and you
know who we are, and we know that you have brought
Raymond, and have come to help.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">Yes.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -3.5em;">O. J. L.&mdash;We that are here know about this, and you have given
us evidence already, but I am here to get evidence for the family.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">Yes.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -3.5em;">O. J. L.&mdash;Would you like to say something first, before I ask a
question?</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>(Silence.)</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">Then the table moved and shook a little, indicating
that it wanted the alphabet; and when the medium
recited the letters, it spelt out in the same
manner as before, <i>i.e.</i> by stopping at the one desired by
whatever intelligence was controlling the table:&mdash;</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">RAYMOND WANTS TO COME HIMSELF.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Here M. L. ejaculated: "Dear Raymond," and sighed
unconsciously.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>The table spelt&mdash;it being understood that Raymond had
now taken control:&mdash;</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">DO NOT SIGH.</span></p>
</div>

<p>M. F. A. L.&mdash;Was I sighing?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -3.5em;">O. J. L.&mdash;Yes, but you must not be so distressed; he doesn't
like it. He is there all right, and I am glad to have some
one on the other side.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">Yes</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>O. J. L.&mdash;Raymond, your mother is much happier now.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">Yes</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>O. J. L.&mdash;Now then, shall I ask you questions?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">Yes</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>O. J. L.&mdash;Well now, wait a minute and take your time, and I will
ask the first question:&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 3em;">"What did the boys call you?"</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[ 140]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">The medium now again repeated the alphabet, the table
tilting to each letter as before,</span></p>
</div>

<p><span style="margin-left: 14em;">first stopping at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17.5em;">then at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17.5em;">then at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P again;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0em;">it then shook as if something was wrong.</span><br />
</p>

<p>O. J. L.&mdash;Very well, try again, begin once more.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">Again it spelt <span class="smcap">Pap</span>, but again indicated dissent, and
tried again: at the third trial it appeared to spell</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">Pas</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>M. F. A. L.&mdash;Raymond dear, you have given two letters right,
try and give the third.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">It now stopped at T; making <span class="smcap">Pat</span>.</span></p>
</div>

<p>M. F. A. L.&mdash;Yes, that is right.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[This was, of course, well in our knowledge and therefore
not strictly evidential, but it would not be in
the knowledge of the medium.] (Cf. p. <a href="#Page_148">148</a>.)</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">Yes</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>O. J. L.&mdash;Well, now, you have done that, shall I ask another?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">Yes</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>O. J. L.&mdash;Will you give the name of a brother?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">The alphabet was repeated as usual by the medium,
in a monotonous manner, the table tilting as before</span></p>
</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left:15em;">and stopping first at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; N</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20.3em;">then at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.7em;">then going past E, it stopped at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15.1em;">and the next time at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.2em;">then, by a single tilt, it indicated&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A or else "No."</span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -3.5em;">O. J. L., thinking that the letters R and M were wrong,
because the (to him) meaningless name <span class="smcap">Norman</span> was evidently being given,
took it as "No," and said:&mdash;</span></p>
</div>

<p>O. J. L.&mdash;You are confused now, better begin again.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">The name accordingly was begun again, and this time it spelt</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">NOEL</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>O. J. L.&mdash;That is right. [But see appended Note, p. <a href="#Page_147">147</a>.]</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">A slight pause took place here; the table then indicated
that it wanted the alphabet again, and spelt out
an apparently single meaningless word which Dr.
Kennedy, as he wrote the letters down, perceived to be</span></p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">FIRE AWAY</span>.</p>

<p>O. J. L.&mdash;Oh! You want another question! Would you like

what he had said to Lieutenant Case, who saw him after he had been struck; and that what
he thought he had said was "So I'm wounded"; but I thought
it unadvisable to continue on this tack, and rather regretted that I had begun it, since
it was liable to put him back into a period of reminiscence
which his friends would prefer that he did not dwell upon. Moreover, these last few
questions did not seem particularly to interest him,
and the responses were comparatively weak. Accordingly, I decided to switch him on to a
topic that would be more likely to interest him.)

The table then spelt with the alphabet for a long time,
and as the words were not divided up, the sitters lost
touch, one after the other, with what was
being said. I, for instance, lost touch after the word
"magnetism," and, for all I know, it was nonsense
that was being said; but the recorder put all the
letters down as they came, each letter being called
out by me according to the stoppages of the table,
and the record reads thus:&mdash;</span></p>

that goes into table; and we manipulate.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[The interest of this is due to the fact that the table
was spelling our coherent words, although the
sitters could hardly, under the circumstances, be
exercising any control. Naturally, this does not
prevent the medium from being supposed to be
tilting out a message herself, and hence it is quite
unevidential of course; but, in innumerable other
cases, the things said were quite outside the knowledge
of the medium.]</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>End of sitting.</i>)</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>To complete the record I shall append the few annotations
which I made a couple of days afterwards, before I
supplement them with later information.</p>

<h3><i>Contemporary Annotations for Table Sitting on<br />
28 September</i></h3>

<p>Very many things were given right at the sitting above
recorded, and in most cases the rightness will be clear from
the comments of the sitters as recorded. But two names
are given on which further annotation is necessary, because
the sitters did not understand them; in other words, they
were such as, if confirmed, would furnish excellent and
indeed exceptional evidence.</p>

<p>The first is 'Norman,' about which a very important
report could be made at once; but I think it better not to
put anything in writing on that subject even now, at the
present stage, since it is quite distinct, unforgettable, and
of the first importance.</p>

<p>The other is the name 'Mitchell,' which at present we
have had no opportunity for verifying; hence annotation
on that must be postponed. Suffice it to say that to-day
(6 October 1915) it remains unknown. Whether an Army
List has been published this year seems doubtful, and on
the whole unlikely; and no Army List later than 1909 has
been so far accessible. Such few inquiries as have up to
now been made have drawn blank. [See, however, three
pages further on.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[ 147]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Later Information</i></h3>

<p>On 10 October Mrs. Kennedy, alone, had some automatic
writing as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Mother, Paul is bringing Raymond. I have him
here; he will speak to you....</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>"Please listen carefully now I want to speak to
you about <span class="smcap">Norman</span>. There is a special meaning
to that because we always called my brother

</div>

<p>(K. K. said that she couldn't get the rest clearly.)</p>

<p>On 12 October we had a sitting with Mrs. Leonard,
K. K. also present, and I said to 'Raymond':&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -3.5em;">Do you want to say anything more about that name
'Norman'? You gave a message about it to Mrs.
Kennedy, but I don't know whether she got it clearly.
Perhaps you want to amplify it? If so, now is your
chance. (The reply spelt out was:&mdash;)</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">I told her that I called Lionel.</span></p>
</div>

<p>On which K. K. said: "I am afraid I often get names
wrong. I suppose I got the name of the wrong
brother."
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Note by O. J. L. about the name 'Norman'</span></h3>

<p>It appears that 'Norman' was a kind of general nickname;
and especially that when the boys played hockey
together, which they often did in the field here, by way of
getting concentrated exercise, Raymond, who was specially
active at this game, had a habit of shouting out,
"Now then, Norman," or other words of encouragement,
to any of his other brothers whom he wished to stimulate,
especially apparently Lionel, though sometimes Alec and the
others. That is what I am now told, and I can easily realise
the manner of it. But I can testify that I was not aware
that a name like this was used, nor was Lady Lodge, we
two being the only members of the family present at the
Leonard table sitting where the name 'Norman' was given.
(See p. <a href="#Page_140">140</a>.)</p>

<p>It will be remembered that at that sitting I first asked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[ 148]</a></span>
him what name the boys had called him, and, after a few
partial failures, obviously only due to mismanagement of
the table, he replied, 'Pat,' which was quite right. I
then asked if he would like to give the name of a brother,
and he replied 'Norman,' which I thought was quite wrong.
I did not even allow him to finish the last letter.
I said he was confused, and had better begin again; after
which he amended it to '*No�l,' which I accepted as correct.
But it will now be observed that the name 'Norman'
was the best he could possibly give, as a kind of
comprehensive nickname applicable to almost any brother.
And a nickname was an appropriate kind of response,
because we had already had the nickname 'Pat,' Furthermore,
on subsequent occasions he explained that it was
the name by which he had called Lionel; and, through
Mrs. Kennedy&mdash;if she did not make a mistake&mdash;that it was
a name he had called Alec by. It is quite possible, however,
that he had intended to say 'Lionel' on that occasion,
and that she got it wrong. I am not sure how that may
be. Again, at a later stage, in a family sitting&mdash;no medium
present&mdash;one of the boys said, "Pat, do you remember 'Norman'?"
at which with some excitement, the girls only touching
the table, he spelt out '<span class="smcap">Hockey</span>'; thus completing the
whole incident.</p>

<p>The most evidential portions, however, are those obtained
when nobody present understood what was being said&mdash;namely,
first, the spelling of the name 'Norman' when those
present thought that it was all a mistake after the first two
letters; and secondly, the explanation to Mrs. Kennedy that
it was a name by which he had called one of his brothers,
showing that it was originally given by no accident, but
with intention.</p>

<p>As to the name 'Pat' (p. <a href="#Page_140">140</a>), I extract the following
from a diary of No�l, as evidence that it was very much
Raymond's nickname; but of course we knew it:&mdash;</p>

<p>

</p>

<h3><i>Note on the name 'Mitchell' (added later)</i></h3>

<p>It can be remembered that, when asked on 28 September
for the name of an officer, Raymond spelt out <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>,
and indicated decisively that the word <span class="smcap">Aeroplane</span> was connected
with him; he also assented to the idea that he was
one whom the family didn't know, and that so it would be
better as evidence (pp. <a href="#Page_141">141</a>, <a href="#Page_142">142</a>).</p>

<p>After several failures at identification I learnt, on 10
October, through the kind offices of the Librarian of the
London Library, that he had ascertained from the War
Office that there was a 2nd Lieut. E. H. Mitchell now
attached to the Royal Flying Corps. Accordingly, I wrote
to the Record Office, Farnborough; and ultimately, on 6
November, received a post card from Captain Mitchell, to
whom I must apologise for the, I hope, quite harmless use
of his name:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Many thanks for your kind letter. I believe I have met
your son, though where I forget. My wounds are quite healed,
and I am posted to Home Establishment for a bit, with rank of
Captain. Your letter only got here (Dover) from France this
morning, so please excuse delay in answering.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">E. H. Mitchell.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>In concluding this chapter, I may quote a little bit of
non-evidential but characteristic writing from 'Paul.' It
was received on 30 September 1915 by Mrs. Kennedy, when
alone, and her record runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>(After writing of other things, I <i>not</i> having asked anything
about Raymond.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I think it hardly possible for you to believe how
quickly Raymond learns; he seems to believe all
that we have to fight to teach the others.</p>

<p>"Poor chaps, you see no one has told them before they
come over, and it is so hard for them when they see
us and they feel alive, and their people keep on
sobbing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[ 150]</a></span></p>

<p>"The business for you and me gets harder and harder
as the days go on, mother; it needs thousand at
this work, and you are so small.</p>

<p>"I feel that God helps us, but I want Him to find
others, darling; there is no time to waste either in
your place or mine, but I know you are trying ever
so hard."</p>

<h2><span class="gesperrt">CHAPTER IX</span><br />
<span class="small">ATTEMPTS AT STRICTER EVIDENCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN a Table Sitting it is manifest that the hypothesis
of unconscious muscular guidance must be pressed
to extremes, as a normal explanation, when the communications
are within the knowledge of any of the people
sitting at the table.</p>

<p>Many of the answers obtained were quite outside the
knowledge of the medium or of Mrs. Kennedy, but many
were inevitably known to us; and in so far as they were
within our knowledge it might be supposed, even by ourselves,
that we partially controlled the tilting, though of
course we were careful to try not to do so. And besides,
the things that came, or the form in which they came, were
often quite unexpected, and could not consciously have
been controlled by us. Moreover, when the sentence
spelt out was a long one, we lost our way in it and could
not tell whether it was sense or nonsense; for the words
ran into each other. The note-taker, who puts each
letter down as it is called out to him by the sitters at the
table, has no difficulty in reading a message, although,
with the words all run together, it hardly looks intelligible
at first sight, even when written. For instance:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">BELESSWORRIEDALECPLEASEOLDCHAP,</p>

<p>which was one message, or:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">GATHEREDINMEDIUMANDTHATGOESINTOTABLEANDWEMANIPULATE,</p>

<p>which was part of another. Neither could be readily
followed if called out slowly letter by letter.</p>

<p>Still, the family were naturally and properly sceptical
about it all.</p>

<p>Accordingly, my sons devised certain questions in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[ 152]</a></span>
nature of tests, referring to trivial matters which they
thought would be within Raymond's recollection, but
which had happened to them alone during summer excursions
or the like, and so were quite outside my knowledge.
They gave me a few written questions, devised in
conclave in their own room; and on 12 October I took
them to London with me in a sealed envelope, which I
opened in the train when going up for a sitting; and after
the sitting had begun I took an early opportunity of
putting the questions it contained. We had already had
(on 28 September, reported in last chapter) one incident of
a kind unknown to us, in the name 'Norman,' but they
wanted more of the same or of a still more marked kind.
I think it will be well to copy the actual contemporary
record of this part of the sitting in full:&mdash;

would co-operate.</p>

<p>A pause of three and a half minutes then ensued, and

<h3><span class="smcap">Note on the Reminiscences awakened by the<br />
Words 'Argonauts' and 'Dartmoor'</span></h3>

<p>On reporting to my sons the answers given about
'Argonauts' and 'Dartmoor' they were not at all
satisfied.</p>

<p>I found, however, from the rest of the family that the
word <span class="smcap">TELEGRAM</span> had a meaning in connexion with
'Argonauts'&mdash;a meaning quite unknown to me or to my
wife&mdash;but it was not the meaning that his brothers had
expected. It seems that in a previous year, while his
mother and I were away from home, the boys travelled
by motor to somewhere in Devonshire, and (as they
think) at Taunton Raymond had gone into a post office,
sent a telegram home to say that they were all right, and
had signed it 'Argonauts.' The girls at home remembered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[ 155]</a></span>
the telegram quite well; the other boys did not specially
remember it.</p>

<p>The kind of reference they had wanted, Raymond gave
ultimately though meagrely, but only after so much time
had elapsed that the test had lost its value, and only
after I had been told to switch him on to "Tent Lodge,
Coniston," as a clue.</p>

<p>Now that I know the answer I do not think the question
was a particularly good one; and the word 'telegram,'
which they had not expected and did not want,
seems to me quite as good an incident as the one which,
without a clue, they had expected him to recall in connexion
with 'Argonauts.' Besides, I happened myself to know
about an Iceland trip in Mr. Alfred Holt's yacht 'Argo'
and its poetic description by Mr. Mitchell Banks and Dr.
Caton in a book in the drawing-room at Tent Lodge,
Coniston (though the boys were not aware of my knowledge),
but it never struck me that this was the thing
wanted; and if it had come, the test would have been of
inferior quality.</p>

<p>Concerning the answer to 'Dartmoor,' his brothers said
that <span class="smcap">COMING DOWN HILL</span> was correct but incomplete; and
that they didn't remember any <span class="smcap">FERRY</span>. I therefore on
another occasion, namely, on 22 October, during a sitting
with Feda (that is to say, not a table sitting, but one
in which Mrs. Leonard's control Feda was speaking and
reporting messages), said&mdash;still knowing nothing about the
matter beyond what I had obtained in the table sitting&mdash;"Raymond,
do you remember about 'Dartmoor' and the
hill?"</p>

<p>The answer is recorded as follows, together with the
explanatory note added soon afterwards&mdash;though the
record is no doubt a little abbreviated, as there was some
dramatic representation by Feda of sudden swerves and
holding on:&mdash;
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h4><i>From Sitting of O. J. L. and M. F. A. L. on</i><br />
22 <i>October</i> 1915. <i>'Feda' speaking</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Raymond, do you remember about Dartmoor and
the hill?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[ 156]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, he said something about that. He says it
was exciting. What is that he says? Brake&mdash;something
about a brake&mdash;putting the brake on. Then he
says, sudden curve&mdash;a curve&mdash; he gives
Feda a jerk like going round a quick curve.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[I thought at the time that this was only
padding, but subsequently learnt from Alec that it was right. It was on a very long
night-journey on their motor, when the
silencer had broken down by bursting, at
the bottom of an exceptionally steep hill, and there was an unnerving
noise. The one who was driving went down other steep
hills at a great pace, with sudden applications of the brake and sudden quick
curves, so that those at the back felt it dangerous,
and ultimately had to stop him and insist on going slower. Raymond was in front with
the one who was driving. The sensations of those at
the back of the car were strongly connected with the brake and with curves;
but they had mainly expected a reference from Raymond to the noise from the broken
silencer, which they ultimately repaired during the same night with tools
obtained at the first town they stopped at.]</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Did he say anything about a ferry?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>No, he doesn't remember that he did.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Well, I got it down.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>There is one: all the same there is one. But
he didn't mean to say anything about it. He says it was a stray thought that he didn't mean to give
through the table. He has found one or two things
come in like that. It was only a stray thought. You have got what you wanted, he says. 'Hill,'
he meant to give, but not 'ferry.' They have
nothing to do with each other.</p>
</div>

<p>On a later occasion I took an opportunity of catechising
him further about this word <span class="smcap">FERRY</span>, since none of
the family remembered a ferry, or could attach any
significance to the word. He still insisted that his
mention of a ferry in connexion with a motor trip was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[ 157]</a></span>
wrong, only he admitted that "some people wouldn't
call it a ferry." I waited to see if any further light would
come; and now, long afterwards, on 18 August 1916 I
receive from Alec a note referring to a recent trip, this
month, which says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"By the way, on the run to Langland Bay
(which is the motor run we all did the year before
the run to Newquay) we pass through Briton Ferry;
and there is precious little ferry about it."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So even this semi-accidental reminiscence seems to be
turning out not altogether unmeaning; though probably
it ought not to have come in answer to 'Dartmoor.' (See
more about Dartmoor on p. <a href="#Page_211">211</a>.)
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">General Remarks on this Type of Question</span></h3>

<p>It will be realised, I think, that a single word, apart
from the context, thus thrown at a person who may be in
a totally different mood at the time, is exceedingly difficult;
and on the whole I think he must be credited with
some success, though not with as much as had been hoped
for. If his brothers had been present, or had had any
interview with him in the meantime, it would have spoilt
the test, considered strictly; nevertheless, it might have
made the obtaining of the answers they wanted much
more feasible, inasmuch as in their presence he would
have been in their atmosphere and be more likely to remember
their sort of surroundings. Up to this date they
had not had any sitting with a medium at all. In
presence of his mother and myself, and under all the
circumstances, and what he felt to be the gravity of some
of his recent experiences, it is not to me surprising that
the answers were only partially satisfactory; though,
indeed, to me they seem rather good. Anyhow, they
had the effect of stimulating his brothers to arrange some
sittings with a table at home on their own account.</p>

him himself; he has been trying to speak to him. Seems to
have something to do with Mrs. Kathie,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and he has tried
to write to him. The trouble is, that he can't always see
distinctly. He feels in the air, but can't see always distinctly.
(To M. F. A. L.) When you are sitting at the
table he sees you, and can see what you have got on.
When he tries to come to you, he can only sense you; but
at the table he can see you.
</p>
</div>

<p>O. J. L.&mdash;Has he seen his brothers at a table?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>No, not at the table. He sensed them, and he thought
they were trying to speak to him; but didn't feel as if he
was going to get near. It has something to do with a
medium. Medium. [Meaning that they were trying to do
without a medium.]</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[ 159]</a></span></p>

<p>M. F. A. L.&mdash;When did he see me?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>When a medium is present he sees you quite distinctly.
He saw you, not here, but at another place. Oh, it was
in London, another place in London, some time ago. He
was surprised to see you, and wondered how he could.
[Presumably the occasion intended was when Mrs. Kennedy,
who herself has power, was present as well as Peters.]
He can only think the things he wants to say.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> [Then
reverting to his brothers' attempts at Mariemont.]
"Tell them to go on. I shall never get tired. Never!
Tell them to have patience. It is more interesting to me
than to them." He does not seem sure if he got anything
through. It is so peculiar. Even here, he is not always
quite certain that he has said what he wanted to say,
except sometimes when it is clear and you jump at it.
Sometimes then he feels, "I've got that home, anyway!"
He has got to feel his way. They must go easy with him&mdash;not
ask too much all at once. If they have plenty of
patience, in a while he will be able to come and talk as if
he were there.
</p>
</div>

<p>M. F. A. L.&mdash;Do you mean with the voice?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>No, with the table.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>More important than talking is to get things through
with his own people, and to give absolute evidence. He
doesn't want them to bother him with test questions till he
feels at home. It doesn't matter here, where there is a
medium, but the conditions there are not yet good. Tell
them to take for granted that it is he, and later on he will
be able to talk to them and say all he wishes to say. The
boys are so eager to get tests. When grandpapa comes, it
is to relieve him a little, while he is not there. He doesn't
himself want to speak.
</p>

<p>Twice a week, he says.</p>

<p>He is bringing a girl with him now&mdash;a young girl,
growing up in the spirit world. She belongs to Raymond:
long golden hair, pretty tall, slight, brings a lily
in her hand. There is another spirit too who passed out
very young&mdash;a boy; you wouldn't know him as he is now;
he looks about the same age as Raymond, but very spiritual
in appearance; he brings a W with him; he doesn't
know much of the earth plane, nor the lily either; he
passed over too young. They are both with Raymond now.
They look spiritual and young. Spirit people look young
if they passed on young. Raymond is in the middle between
them. He says this is not very scientific. [All this is
appropriate to a deceased brother and sister; the brother
older, the sister younger.]</p>

<p>Raymond really is happy now. He doesn't say this to
make you feel satisfied. He is really happy now. He says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[ 160]</a></span>
this is most interesting, and is going to be fifty times more
interesting than on the earth plane. There is such a big
field to work in. Father and he are going to do such a lot
together. He says, "I am going to help for all I am
worth." (To M. F. A. L.) If you are happy, I will be happier
too. You used to sigh; it had an awful effect on him,
but he is getting lighter with you. Father has been wonderful.
He is often with Paulie, and has been to see Mrs.
Kathie too.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[Meaning Mrs. Katherine Kennedy. Feda, of course, is
speaking throughout.]</span></p>
</div>

<p>M. F. A. L.&mdash;Which way does he find the easiest to come?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He is able to get to you by impression, and not only by
writing. He thinks he can make you hear. He is trying
to make you clair-audient. Let there be no misapprehension
about that. He does it in order to help himself.
He hopes to get something through.</p>
</div>

<p>O. J. L.&mdash;You might send the same thing through different
channels.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, he says. He need not say much, but is going
to think it out. He can get Mrs. K. to write it out, and
then get it through the table with them. He thinks he
will be able to do a lot with you, Mrs. Kathie. You know
that Paulie's here?</p>

<p>(K. K. spoke to Paul for a short time.)</p>
</div>

<p>O. J. L.&mdash;Do you think it had better be tried on the same evening,
or on different evenings?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Try it on the same evening at first, and see what success
is got; if only one word came through the same, he
would be very pleased. He might get one word first, then
two, then two or three. Tell them to reserve a little time
for just that, and give him some time specially for it, not
mix it up with other things in the sittings.</p>
</div>

<p>K. K.&mdash;Shall I ask him to write some word?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He will think of some word&mdash;no matter if it is meaningless.
What you have to do is, not to doubt, but take it
down. One word might be much more valuable than a
long oration. One word would do, no matter how silly
it sounded; even if it is only a jumble, so long as it is the
same jumble. He is jumping now. [Meaning, he is pleased
with the idea.] He says he finds it difficult owing to the
medium. He is not able to get through all he wants to
say, but on the whole thinks he got it pretty straight
to-night.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[The quickness with which the communicator jumped
at the idea of a cross-correspondence was notable,
because I do not think he had known anything about
them. It sounded rather like the result of rapid
Myersian instruction. I rather doubt if cross-correspondences
of this kind can be got through
Mrs. Kennedy, though she knows we are going to
try for them. The boys are quite willing to take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[ 161]</a></span>
down any jumble, but she herself likes to understand
what she gets, and automatically rejects gibberish.&mdash;O.

<hr class="r15" />

<p>On 13 October, through the kind arrangement of Mrs.
Kennedy, we had an anonymous sitting with a medium
new to us, a Mrs. Brittain, of Hanley, Staffordshire, in
Mrs. Kennedy's house.</p>

<p>It was not very successful&mdash;the medium seemed tired
and worried&mdash;but there were a few evidential points
obtained, though little or nothing about the boy; in the
waking stage, however, she said that some one was calling
the name 'Raymond.'</p>

<p>At an interview next day with Mrs. Kennedy, Mrs.
Brittain said that a boy named 'Pat' had come with
Paul to see her on the evening after the sitting (see p. <a href="#Page_148">148</a>
for the significance of 'Pat'); and she described it in
writing to Mrs. Kennedy thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
14 <i>October</i> 1915<br />
</p>

<p>"I was just resting, thinking over the events of the day,
and worrying just a little about my ordeal of next Monday,
when I became conscious of the presence of such a dear soldier
boy. He said, 'I am Pat, and oh, I did want to speak to my mother.'
Then I saw with him your dear boy [Paul]; he asked me to tell
you about Pat, and to give the message to his father that he would
get proof without seeking it."</p>

<h2><span class="gesperrt">CHAPTER XI</span><br />
<span class="small">FIRST SITTING OF ALEC (A. M. L.)</span></h2>
</div>

<h3><i>Introduction by O. J. L.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">A WORD may be necessary about the attitude of Raymond's
family to the whole subject. It may be thought that my
own known interest in the subject was naturally shared
by the family, but that is not so. So far as I can judge, it
had rather the opposite effect; and not until they had received
unmistakable proof, devised largely by themselves, was this
healthy scepticism ultimately broken down.</p>

<p>My wife had had experience with Mrs. Piper in 1889, though
she continued very sceptical till 1906 or thereabouts, when she had
some extraordinarily good evidence. But none of this experience
was shared by the family, who read neither my nor anyone else's
books on the subject, and had no first-hand evidence. For the
most part they regarded it without interest and with practical
scepticism. If in saying this I convey the impression of anything
like friction or disappointment, the impression is totally false.
Life was full of interest of many kinds, and, until Raymond's
death, there was no need for them to think twice about survival or
the possibility of communication.</p>

<p>The first sitting held by any of his brothers, apart from private
amateur attempts at home,&mdash;the first sitting, I may say, held by
any of them with any medium,&mdash;took place on 23 October, when
Alec had a sitting with Peters; his mother also was present, but
no names were given. Alec's record of this sitting, together with
his preliminary Note, I propose to quote practically in full.</p>

<p>Alec and his mother went in the morning to Mrs. Kennedy's
house, where the sitting was to take place. M. F. A. L. stopped
on the way to buy a bunch of violets, which she put on Peters'
table. When he arrived and saw them, he was very pleased;
ejaculated "my flower," and said that he could not have had anything
that gave him more pleasure.</p>

<p>I may here remark, incidentally, that Peters is a man who
takes his mediumship seriously, and tries to regulate his life so as
to get good conditions. Thus, he goes into the country at intervals,
and stops all work for a time to recuperate. He lives, in fact,
at Westgate-on-Sea, and only has a room in London. He seems
to lead a simple life altogether, and his "control" spoke of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[ 163]</a></span>
having been prepared since six o'clock that morning for this
sitting.</p>

<p>Alec went up prepared to take notes, and after the sitting
wrote the following preliminary account:&mdash;
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h3><i>A. M. L.'s Remarks on the Sitting</i></h3>

<p>Mother and I arrived at Mrs. Kennedy's house at
five minutes to eleven. We saw Mrs. Kennedy, who
asked us if we would like her to be present. We said
yes. Then she told us that Peters had come, and that she
would ask him. Peters wanted her to be present.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kennedy brought Peters up; he shook hands,
without any introduction. We had all gone up to Mrs.
Kennedy's private room, where Peters likes the sittings to
take place. We four sat round a table about four feet in
diameter. A. and M. with backs to one or other of the
two windows, K. and P. more or less facing them. A.
was opposite P.; M. was opposite K. There was plenty of
light, but the room was partly shaded by pulling down
blinds. They talked about street noises at first. P. held
K.'s and M.'s hands for a time. K. and M. talked together
a little. P. now moved about a little and rubbed his face
and eyes. Suddenly he jerked himself up and began talking
in broken English.</p>

<p>During the trance his eyes were apparently closed all
the time; and when speaking to anyone he 'looked' at
them with his eyelids screwed up. Sometimes a change
of control occurred. While that was taking place, he
sat quiet, and usually held K.'s and M.'s hands until
another sudden jerk occurred, when he let go and started
talking.</p>

<p>The sitting was rather disjointed, and most of it
apparently not of much importance, but for a few minutes
in the middle it was very impressive. It then felt to me
exactly as if my hand was being held in both Raymond's,
and as if Raymond himself was speaking in his own voice.
My right hand was being held, but even if I had had it free
I could not possibly have taken notes under the circumstances.</p>

<p>(M. F. A. L. adds that neither could she nor anyone,
while that part of the sitting was going on.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[ 164]</a></span></p>

<p>Peters spoke often very quickly, and sometimes indistinctly,
so that the notes are rather incomplete.</p>

<p>(To this O. J. L. adds that it was Alec's first experience
of a sitting, and that, even with experience, it is
difficult to take anything like full notes.)

<h3><i>Report of Peters Sitting in Mrs. Kennedy's Room, at<br />
11 a.m. on Saturday, 23 October 1915</i></h3>

<p class="center">(Revised by the Sitters)</p>

<p class="center"><i>Present</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mrs. Kennedy</span> (K. K.), <span class="smcap">Lady Lodge</span> (M. F. A. L.),<br />
<span class="smcap">Alec M. Lodge</span>, and the Medium&mdash;<span class="smcap">Vout Peters</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Report by</span> A. M. L.
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>In a short time Peters went into trance, and 'Moonstone'
was understood to be taking control. He first made
some general remarks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Good morning! I generally say, "Good evening,"
don't I? Don't be afraid for Medie; he has
been prepared since six o'clock this morning.
Magnetism has to be stored up, and therefore it is
best to use the same room and the same furniture
every time.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply2">
<p>Then he spoke to K. K.:&mdash;</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Will you call on little woman close to? It will
mean salvation to two people. [Abbreviated.]</p>
</div>

<p>(K. K. understood.)</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">Then the medium took M.'s hand.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Somebody not easy to describe; old lady; not
tall; grey hair, parted in centre; grey eyes; nose
thin; mouth fairly large and full. This describes
her as she was before she passed away. Had
big influence on your early life. Good character;
loving, but perhaps lived in narrow outlook; not
only a mother to her own belongings, but she
mothered every man, woman, or child she came
into contact with. She is here this morning and
has been before. Is it not your Mother?</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">M. F. A. L.</span>&mdash;If it is my Mother, it is a great pleasure to
me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[ 165]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>She has been with you and comforted you
through this trial.</p>

<p>She has been, and will go on, looking after the
boy. You must not think she is not just as much
with you because she has no body. She is just as
much your mother. She <i>has</i> a body, though it is
different.</p>

<p>(Pointing to A.) She is related to <i>him</i>. She
puts her hand on his shoulder. She is very proud
of what he is doing at the present time. He has
been a great help to you. Since the passing away
of him who is loved by you both, he has looked
on spiritualism with much more respect, because
previously it has not touched his heart. It is not
only a thing of the head, it is now a thing of the
heart.</p>

<p>She suffered terribly before passing away. She
bore her suffering patiently.</p>

<p>She put her finger on her lips and says: "I am
so proud of O.!" (Medium puts one finger on
middle of lips.)</p>

<p>It has always been what I thought: the
triumph (?) has been a long time coming, but it will
come greater than had been anticipated. There
have been difficulties. I am glad of success. It
will come greater than before. The book that is to
be will be written from the heart, and not the head.
But the book will not be written now. <span class="smcap">Not now!</span>
<span class="smcap">Not now!</span> <span class="smcap">Not now!</span> (loud). Written later on.
<span class="smcap">The Book</span> which is going to help many and convert
many. The work done already is big. But
what is coming is bigger.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">(Interval.)
</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">(Paul, sending a message to K. K.:&mdash;)</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>I have been drilling her to link up. You don't
know what it is. It is like teaching people to
transmit messages by the telegraph. Don't let
the boy come, let Granny come. (The medium
here imitated Paul's manner of sitting down and
pulling up the knees of his trousers.) She laughs
at the idea of being drilled.</p>

<p>He says (Paul still communicating): You know,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[ 166]</a></span>
little Mother, you wonder why I was taken; but
it is a great deal better like this. Thousands of
people can be helped like this. You are the link,
and the means of reaching thousands of mothers.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">(Then 'Moonstone' was understood to say:&mdash;)</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Returning to Madam (<i>i.e.</i> the old lady again,
and medium turning to M. F. A. L.), she says:
"I am so glad you not only told him what you did&mdash;this
is not to you but some one away (finger on
lips), somebody she will not give&mdash;and reached out
as you did."</p>

<p>This is from Madam. She is going away.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">M. F. A. L.</span>&mdash;My love to her.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>No, no, no, she does not go away; she stands
back, to let some one else come forward&mdash;like
actors take turns at a theatre.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[Then an impersonation of my Uncle Jerry
was represented, with the statement, "Your
husband will know who he is"; but this
part of the record is omitted as comparatively
unimportant. It was unintelligible
to the sitter.&mdash;O. J. L.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">(Then a new control came in, which was by
K. K. understood to be 'Redfeather.' When he arrived, the medium smacked
his hands and spoke to K. K.:&mdash;)</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>I come dis little minute to try experiment. If
we succeed, all right; if we don't, don't mind.
There will be some difficulties.</p>

<p>You know me? (To K. K.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">K. K.</span>&mdash;Yes. It is 'Redfeather.'</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Glad to see you better. You used to feel&mdash;a
hand on your head. It was a little girl. It was
your boy who brought her. Now I go. Just talk
a little.</p>
</div>

<p>(K. K. then thanked the speaker for his help.)</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Who could help better than me?</p>

<p><span class="gesperrt">...</span> long ago I was killed.</p>

<p>Who could help better?</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">(Then there was an interval, and evident
change of control. And speech very indistinct
at first.)</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[ 167]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>I want to come.</p>

<p>Call Mother to help me.</p>

<p>Because you know.</p>

<p>You understand.</p>

<p>It wasn't so bad.</p>

<p>Not so bad.</p>

<p>I knew you knew the possibility of communicating,
so when I went out as I did, I was in a
better condition than others on the other side.
We had often talked about this subject, father
understanding it as he did; and now, coming
into touch with his strength, makes it easy.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">(Medium here reached out across the table to
A. and grasped his right hand, so that the
notes were temporarily interrupted. The
medium's arms were now both stretched out
across the table, with his head down on
them, and he held A.'s hand in both his.
All this time he spoke with great emotion:
the medium was shaken with sobs; his
head and neck were suffused with blood;
the whole circumstances were strained, and
strongly emotional; and the voice was
extraordinarily like Raymond's. A., too,
felt that his hands were being gripped in a
grasp just like Raymond's. This was the
central part of the sitting; and for the
time no notes could be taken, even by Mrs.
Kennedy. But after a bit the hand was
released, the strain rather lightened, and
notes continue which run thus:&mdash;)</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[A. M. L. says, "In time the interval was brief,"
but it was surcharged with emotion, strongly felt by all present.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>But no, wait.</p>

<p>Because they tell me.</p>

<p>I am not ashamed.</p>

<p>I am glad.</p>

<p>I tell you, I would do it again.</p>

<p>I realise things differently to what one saw here.</p>

<p>And oh, thank God, I can speak!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[ 168]</a></span></p>

<p>But &mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The boys help me.</p>

<p>You don't know what he has done.</p>

<p>Who could help?</p>

<p>But I must keep quiet, I promised them to keep
calm.</p>

<p>The time is so short.</p>

<p>Tell father that I am happy.</p>

<p>That I am happy that he has not come.</p>

<p>If he had come here, I couldn't have spoken.</p>

<p>I find it difficult to express what I want.</p>

<p>Every time I come back it is easier.</p>

<p>The only thing that was hard was just before.</p>

<p>The 15th, do you understand?</p>

<p>And the 12th.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[We do not clearly understand these dates.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>But every time I come it is better.</p>

<p>Grandmamma helped or I couldn't.</p>

<p>Now I must go.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; broken &mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But I have done it, thank God!</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">(Then this special control ended; while the
medium murmured, as to himself, first the
word 'John,' and then the word 'God.'
Then the strain was relieved by a new
control, understood to be 'Biddy.')</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Surely it's meself that has come to speak.

mothers. Well, I am going. But for comfort,&mdash;the

<h3>NOTE BY O. J. L.</h3>

<p>Lady Lodge impressed me considerably with the genuine
and deeply affecting character of the above episode of personal
control. It was evidently difficult to get over for the
rest of the day. I doubt if the bare record conveys much:
though it may to people of like experience.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><span class="gesperrt">CHAPTER XII</span><br />
<span class="small">GENERAL REMARKS ON CONVERSATIONAL<br />
REPORTS AND ON CROSS-CORRESPONDENCES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT may be asked why I report so much of what may be
called ordinary conversation, instead of abbreviating
and concentrating on specific instances and definite statements
of fact. I reply:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">1. That a concentrated version is hard to read, while a
fuller version is really less tedious in spite of its greater
length. A record is always a poor substitute for actual
experience; and too much abbreviation might destroy whatever
relic of human interest the records possess.</p>

<p class="p2">2. That abbreviation runs the risk of garbling and
amending; it is undesirable in reports of this kind to amend
style at the expense of accuracy.</p>

<p class="p2">3. That the mannerisms and eccentricities of a 'control'
(or secondary personality) are interesting, and may be
instructive; at any rate they exhibit to a novice the kind
of thing to be expected.</p>

<p class="p2">4. A number of inquiries want to know&mdash;and I think
properly want to know&mdash;what a sitting is like, what kind
of subjects are talked about, what the 'communicators'&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
the hypothetical personalities who send messages
through the 'control'&mdash;have to say about their own feelings
and interests and state of existence generally. Hence, however
the record be interpreted, it seems better to quote some
specimens fully.</p>

<p class="p2">5. I am aware that some of the records may appear
absurd. Especially absurd will appear the free-and-easy
statements, quoted later, about the nature of things 'on the
other side,'&mdash;the kind of assertions which are not only
unevidential but unverifiable, and which we usually either
discourage or suppress. I have stated elsewhere my own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[ 172]</a></span>
reasons for occasionally encouraging statements of
this kind and quoting them as they stand. (See
beginning of <a href="#Page_191">Chapter XVI</a>.) And though I admit that to
publish them is probably indiscreet, I still think that the
evidence, such as it is, ought to be presented as
a whole.</p>

<p class="p2">6. The most evidential class of utterance, what we call
cross-correspondence, is not overlooked; and while every
now and then it occurs naturally and spontaneously, sometimes
an effort is made to obtain it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Note about the Meaning of Cross-Correspondence</span></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>It will be convenient to explain that by the term "Cross-correspondence"
is meant the obtaining through two or more
independent mediums, at about the same time, a message from a
single communicator on any one definite subject.</p>

<p>It is usually impossible for the coincidence of time to be exact,
because both mediums may not be sitting at the same time. But
in some cases, wherein coincidence of subject is well marked,
coincidence in time is of little moment; always provided that the
subject is really an out-of-the-way or far-fetched one, and not one
common to every English-speaking person, like Kitchener or
Roberts or Jellicoe.</p>

<p>Cross-correspondences are of various grades. The simplest
kind is when two mediums both use the same exceptional word, or
both refer to the same non-public event, without any normal reason
that can be assigned. Another variety is when, say, three mediums
refer to one and the same idea in different terms,&mdash;employing, for
instance, different languages, like 'mors,' 'death,' and 'thanatos.'
(See <i>Proc.</i>, S.P.R., xxii, 295-304.) Another is when the idea
is thoroughly masked and brought in only by some quotation&mdash;perhaps
by a quotation the special significance of which is
unknown to the medium who reproduces it, and is only detected
and interpreted by a subsequent investigator to whom all the
records are submitted. Sometimes a quotation is maltreated,
evidently with intention, by the communicator; the important
word to which attention is being directed being either omitted
or changed.</p>

<p>A large number of examples of this more complex kind of
cross-correspondence are reported at length in the <i>Proceedings</i> of
the Society for Psychical Research; see especially vol. xxi. p. 369
and xxii. <i>passim</i>, or a briefer statement in <i>Survival of Man</i>,
chap. xxv.</p>

<p>Some of these instances as expounded by Mr. Piddington may
seem extraordinarily complicated and purposely concealed. That
is admitted. They are specially designed to eliminate the possibility
of unintended and unconscious telepathy direct from one
medium to another, and to throw the investigator back on what is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[ 173]</a></span>
asserted to be the truth, namely that the mind of one single communicator,
or the combined mind of a group of communicators,&mdash;all
men of letters,&mdash;is sending carefully designed messages through
different channels, in order to prove primarily the reality of the
operating intelligence, and incidentally the genuineness of the
mediums who are capable of receiving and transmitting fragments
of messages so worded as to appear to each of them
separately mere meaningless jargon; though ultimately when all
the messages are put together by a skilled person the meaning is
luminous enough. Moreover, we are assured that the puzzles and
hidden allusions contained in these messages are not more difficult
than literary scholars are accustomed to; that, indeed, they are
precisely of similar order.</p>

<p>This explanation is unnecessary for the simple cross-correspondences
(c.c.) sometimes obtained and reported here; but the
subject itself is an important one, and is not always understood
even by investigators, so I take this opportunity of referring to it
in order to direct the attention of those who need stricter evidence
to more profitable records.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><span class="smcap">General Note</span></h3>

<p>Returning to the kind of family records here given, in
which evidence is sporadic rather than systematic though
none the less effective, one of the minor points, which
yet is of interest, is the appropriate way in which different
youths greet their relatives. Thus, while Paul calls his
father 'Daddy' and his mother by pet names, as he used
to; and while Raymond calls us simply 'Father' and
'Mother,' as he used to; another youth named Ralph&mdash;an
athlete who had fallen after splendid service in the war&mdash;greeted
his father, when at length that gentleman was
induced to attend a sitting, with the extraordinary salutation
"Ullo 'Erb!," spelt out as one word through the table;
though, to the astonishment of the medium, it was admitted
to be consistent and evidential. The ease and freedom with
which this Ralph managed to communicate are astonishing,
and I am tempted to add as an appendix some records
which his family have kindly allowed me to see,
but I refrain, as they have nothing to do with
Raymond.</p>

<span class="small">AN O. J. L. SITTING WITH PETERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the 29th of October I had a sitting with Peters
alone, unknown to the family, who I felt sure were
still sceptical concerning the whole subject. It was
arranged for, as an anonymous sitting, by my friend Mr.
J. Arthur Hill of Bradford. The things said were remarkable,
and distinctly pointed to clairvoyance. I am doubtful
about reporting more than a few lines, however. There
was a great deal that might be taken as encouraging and
stimulating, intermixed with the more evidential portions.
A small part of this sitting is already reported in <a href="#Page_96">Chapter
III</a>, and might now be read by anyone interested in the historical
sequence.</p>

<p>A few unimportant opening lines I think it necessary to
report, because of their connexion with another sitting:&mdash;
</p>

<h3><i>Anonymous O. J. L. Sitting with A. Vout Peters at 15
Devereux Court, Fleet Street, on Friday,<br />
29 October 1915, from 10.30 to 11.45 a.m.</i></h3>

<p class="center">(Sitter only spoken of as a friend of Mr. Hill)<a name="FNanchor_21_21"
id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -3.5em;"><span class="smcap">PETERS.</span>&mdash;Before we begin, I must say something: I feel
that I have a certain fear of you, I don't know what
it is, but you affect me in a most curious way. I
must tell you the honest truth before I am controlled....</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[Whatever this may mean it corresponds with
what was said at the previous M. F. A. L.
Sitting, p. <a href="#Page_132">132</a>, though M. F. A. L. had sat
as a friend of Mrs. Kennedy in her house,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[ 175]</a></span>
and I sat as a friend of Mr. Hill in Peters's
room, and no sort of connexion was indicated
between us].</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">(Soon afterwards the medium twitched, snapped
his fingers, and began to speak as 'Moonstone':&mdash;)</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>"I come to speak to you, but I must get my
Medie deep; we get superficial control first, and then
go deeper and deeper; with your strong personality
you frighten him a little; I find a little fear in the
medium.... You bring with you a tremendous
amount of work and business," etc.</p>

<p>Now I get a new influence: an old lady, medium
height, rounded face; light eyes; grey hair; small
nose; lips somewhat thin, or held together as suppressed;
a lady with very strong will; tremendously
forcible she is. She passed away after leading a
very active life....</p>

<p>She's a very good woman. It is not the first time
she has come back. She tells me to tell you that
they are all here. <span class="smcap">All</span>. Because they are trying
to reach out to you their love and sympathy at the
present occasion, and they are thanking you both for
the opportunity of getting back to you. "We are
trying all we can also to bring him back to you, to
let you realise that your faith, which you have held
as a theory"&mdash;it is curious, but she wants me to
say her message word for word&mdash;"as a theory for
years, shall be justified." Then she rejoices ...
(and refers to religious matters, etc.). [This clearly
suggested the relative whose first utterance of this
kind is reported so long ago as 1889 in <i>Proc.</i>, S.P.R.,
vol. vi. p. 468 &amp; 470.]</p>

<p>Now she brings up a young man from the back.
I must explain what we mean by 'the back' some
time.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;But I understand.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He is of medium height; somewhat light eyes;
the face browned somewhat; fairly long nose; the
lips a little full; nice teeth. He is standing pretty
quiet.</p>

<p>Look here, I know this man! And it is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[ 176]</a></span>
the first time he has been to us. Now he smiles,
'cos I recsonise him [so pronounced], but he comes
back very, very strongly. He tells me that he is
pushing the door open wider. Now he wants me
to give you a message. He is going to try to come
down with you; because it looks to me as though
you are travelling to-day. "Down," he says. "I
come down with you. We will try" (he says 'we,'
not 'I'), "we will try to bring our united power
to prove to you that I am here; I and the
other young man who helped me, and who will
help me."</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[The association of Raymond with 'another
young man,' and his intention to come 'down'
with me when I travelled back home on the
same day to meet Mrs. Kennedy there, are
entirely appropriate.&mdash;O. J. L.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Look here, it is your boy! Because he calls you
'Father'; not 'Pa,' nor anything, but 'Father.'
[True.]</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Yes, my son.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Wait a minute; now he wants to tell me one
thing: "I am so glad that you took such a common-sense
view of the subject, and that you didn't
force it on mother. But you spoke of it as an
actuality. She treated it like she treats all your
things that she couldn't understand; giving you,
as she always has done, the credit of being more
clever than herself. But when I came over as I
did, and in her despair, she came to you for help;
but she wanted to get away from anything that
you should influence."</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[Unfortunately, some one knocked at the door&mdash;a
servant probably, wanted to come in and
clear the room. The medium jerked and
said, "Tell them to go away." I called out,
"Can't come in now, private, engaged."
Some talking continued outside for a little
time&mdash;very likely it was some one wanting
an interview with Peters. After a time the
disturbance ceased. It was not very loud;
the medium ignored it, except for the rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[ 177]</a></span>
loud and strong knock, which certainly perturbed
him.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Tell me where I was.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">(I repeated: "She wanted to get away from
anything that you should influence.")</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Oh yes. He wants to say that you were quite
right in staying away and letting her work altogether
by herself. She was able to do better than
if you had been there. You would have spoilt it.</p>

<p>Your common-sense method of approaching the
subject in the family has been the means of helping
him to come back as he has been able to do;
and had he not known what you had told him, then
it would have been far more difficult for him to
come back. He is very deliberate in what he says.
He is a young man that knows what he is
saying.</p>

<p>Do you know F. W. M.?</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Yes, I do.</p>

<p>[The next portion, relating to Myers, has been
already reported in <a href="#Page_96">Chapter III</a>; and the concluding
portion, which is rather puzzling, shall be suppressed, as it relates to other
people.]</p>

<p>Towards the end 'Moonstone' began talking about himself,
which he does in an interesting manner, and I shall
perhaps give him an opportunity of saying more about the
assumption of 'control' from his point of view. Meanwhile
I quote this further extract:&mdash;
</p>

<h3>MOONSTONE'S' ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF</h3>

<blockquote>
<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Have you been suffering inside?</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;No, not that I know of.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Your heart's been bleeding. You never thought you
could love so deep. There must be more or less suffering.
Even though you are crucified, you will arise the stronger,
bigger, better man. But out of this suffering and crucifixion,
oh, how you are going to help humanity! This is a
big work. It has been prophesied. It is through the
sufferings of humanity that humanity is reached. It must
be through pain. Let me tell you something about myself.
I was Yogi&mdash;do you understand?</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Yes; a kind of hermit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[ 178]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>I lived a selfish life: a good life, but a selfish one,
though I didn't know it then. I isolated myself and did
not mix with people, not even with family life. When I go
over, I find it was a negative goodness, so then I wanted
to help humanity, because I hadn't helped it. I had not
taken on the sufferings even of a family man. It was useless.
And so that is why I came back to my Medie, and try
to bear through him the sorrows of the world. It is through
suffering that humanity is helped. That is one great thing
in your beautiful religion; you know what I mean&mdash;the
sacrifice of Jesus. He demonstrated eternity, but to do it
He must be sacrificed and taste death. So all who teach the
high ... must tread the same path; there's no escaping
the crucifixion, it comes in one way or another. And you
must remember, back in the past, when the good things
came to you, how you began to realise (?) that there was a
spirit world and a possibility of coming back. Though you
speak cautiously, yet possibly in your prayers to God you
say, "Let me suffer, let me know my cross, so that I can
benefit humanity"; and when you make a compact with
the unseen world, it is kept. You have told no one this,
but it belongs to you and to your son. Out of it will come
much joy, much happiness to others.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Stead was, I understand, a friend to Peters, and
how much of the above is tinged by Mr. Stead's influence,
I cannot say: but immediately afterwards his name was
mentioned, in the following way:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Flashing down the line comes a message from Mr.
Stead. I can't help it, I must give it. He says: "We
did not see eye to eye; you thought I was too impetuous
and too rash, but our conclusions are about the same now.
We are pretty well on the level, and I have realised, even
through mistakes, that I have reached and influenced a
world that is suffering and sorrowing. But you have a world
bigger and wider than mine, and your message will be
bigger and will reach farther."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p>As far as evidence is concerned, Peters has done well
at each of the three sittings any member of my family has
had with him since Raymond's death. On the whole, I
think he has done as well as any medium; especially as
the abstention from supplying him normally with any identifying
information has been strict.</p>

<p>It is true that I have not, through Peters, asked test
questions of which the answers were unknown to me, as I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[ 179]</a></span>
did at one sitting with Mrs. Leonard (<a href="#Page_151">Chapter IX</a>). But
the answers there given, though fairly good, and in my view
beyond chance, were not perfect. Under the circumstances
I think they could hardly have been expected to be perfect.
It was little more than a month since the death, and new
experiences and serious surroundings must have been
crowding in upon the youth, so that old semi-frivolous
reminiscences were difficult to recall. There was, however,
with Peters no single incident so striking as the name 'Norman,'
to me unknown and meaningless, which was given
in perfectly appropriate connexion through the table at Mrs.
Leonard's.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<blockquote>
<p class="footnote"><span class="smcap"><b>Footnotes</b></span></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Whether it be assumed that I was known or not, does not
much matter; but I have no reason to suppose that I was. Rather the
contrary. Peters seems barely to look at his sitters, and to be anxious
to receive no normal information.</p>

<h2><span class="gesperrt">CHAPTER XIV</span><br />
<span class="small">FIRST SITTING OF LIONEL (ANONYMOUS)</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">AT length, on 17 November 1915, Raymond's brother
Lionel (L. L.) went to London to see if he could
get an anonymous sitting with Mrs. Leonard, without
the intervention of Mrs. Kennedy or anybody. He
was aware that by that time the medium must have sat
with dozens of strangers and people not in any way connected
with our family, and fortunately he succeeded in
getting admitted as a complete stranger. This therefore
is worth reporting, and the contemporary record follows.
A few portions are omitted, partly for brevity, partly because
private, but some non-evidential and what may seem
rather absurd statements are reproduced, for what they
are worth. It must be understood that Feda is speaking
throughout, and that she is sometimes reporting in the third
person, sometimes in the first, and sometimes speaking for
herself. It is unlikely that lucidity is constant all the time,
and Feda may have to do some padding. She is quite good
and fairly careful, but of course, like all controls, she is
responsible for certain mannerisms, and in her case for
childishly modified names like 'Paulie,' etc. The dramatic
circumstances of a sitting will be familiar to people of experience.
The record tries to reproduce them&mdash;probably
with but poor success. And it is always possible that the
attempt, however conscientious, may furnish opportunity
for ridicule, if any hostile critic thinks ridicule appropriate.</p>

<h3><i>L. L.'s Sitting with Mrs. Leonard at her house,<br />as a
stranger, no one else being present,<br />12 o'clock, Wednesday,
17 November 1915.</i></h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Introduction by O. J. L.</span></h3>

<p>Lionel wrote to Mrs. Leonard at her old address in Warwick
Avenue, for I had forgotten that she had moved, and I had not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[ 181]</a></span>
told him her new address. He wrote on plain paper from Westminster
without signing it, saying that he would be coming at a
certain time. But she did not get the letter; so that, when he
arrived about noon on Wednesday, 17 November, he arrived as a
complete stranger without an appointment. He had at first
gone to the wrong house and been redirected. Mrs. Leonard
answered the door. She took him in at once when he said he
wanted a sitting. She drew the blind down, and lit a red lamp as
usual. She told him that she was controlled by 'Feda.' Very
quickly&mdash;in about two minutes&mdash;the trance began, and Feda spoke.</p>

<p>Here follows his record:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Good morning!</p>

<p>Why, you are psychic yourself!</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">L. L.</span>&mdash;I didn't know I was.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>It will come out later.</p>

<p>There are two spirits standing by you; the elder
is fully built up, but the younger is not clear yet.</p>

<p>The elder is on the tall side, and well built; he
has a beard round his chin, but no moustache.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">
(This seemed to worry Feda, and she repeated
it several times, as if trying to make it clear.)</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>A beard round chin, and hair at the sides, but
upper lip shaved. A good forehead, eyebrows heavy
and rather straight&mdash;not arched&mdash;eyes greyish; hair
thin on top, and grey at the sides and back. It looks
as if it had been brown before it went grey. A
fine-looking face. He is building up something. He
suffered here before he passed out (medium indicating
chest or stomach). Letter W is held up.
(See photograph facing p. <a href="#Page_258">258</a>.)</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[This is the one that to other members of the
family had been called Grandfather W.,
p. <a href="#Page_143">143</a>.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>There is another spirit.</p>

<p>Somebody is laughing.</p>

<p>Don't joke&mdash;it is serious.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">(This was whispered, and sounded as if said to
some one else, not to me.)</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>It's a young man, about twenty-three, or might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[ 182]</a></span>
be twenty-five, judging only by appearance. Tall;
well-built; not stout, well-built; brown hair, short at
the sides and back; clean shaven; face more oval
than round; nose not quite straight, rather rounded,
and broader at the nostrils.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>(<i>Whispering.</i>) Feda can't see his face.</p>

<p>(<i>Then clearly.</i>) He won't let Feda see his face;
he is laughing.</p>

<p>(<i>Whispered several times.</i>) L, L, L.</p>

<p>(<i>Then said out loud.</i>) L. This is not his name;
he puts it by you.</p>

<p>(<i>Whispering again.</i>) Feda knows him&mdash;Raymond.</p>

<p>Oh, it's Raymond!</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">
(The medium here jumps about, and fidgets with
her hands, just as a child would when pleased.)</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>That is why he would not show his face, because
Feda would know him.</p>

<p>He is patting you on the shoulder hard. You
can't feel it, but he thinks he is hitting you hard.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[It seems to have been a trick of his to pat a
brother on the shoulder gradually harder and
harder till humorous retaliation set in.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He is very bright.</p>

<p>This is the way it is given&mdash;it's an impression.</p>

<p>He has been trying to come to you at home, but
there has been some horrible mix-ups; not really
horrible, but a muddle. He really got through to
you, but other conditions get through there, and
mixes him up.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">
[This evidently refers to some private 'Mariemont'
sittings, without a medium, with which
neither Feda nor Mrs. Leonard had had anything
to do. It therefore shows specific knowledge
and is of the nature of a mild cross-correspondence;
cf. p. <a href="#Page_217">217</a>.]</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">L. L.</span>&mdash;How can we improve it?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He does not understand it sufficiently himself
yet. Other spirits get in, not bad spirits, but ones
that like to feel they are helping. The peculiar
manifestations are not him, and it only confuses
him terribly. Part of it was him, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[ 183]</a></span>
when the table was careering about, it was not
him at all. He started it, but something comes
along stronger than himself, and he loses the
control.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>(<i>Whispered.</i>) "Feda, can't you suggest something?"</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[This seemed to be a reported part of conversation
on the other side.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Be very firm when it starts to move about.</p>

<p>Prayer helps when things are not relevant.</p>

<p>He is anxious about F.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">L. L.</span>&mdash;I don't know who F. is. Is it some friend?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">(Medium here fidgets.)</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Letter F. all right; it's some one he is interested
in.</p>

<p>He says he is sorry he worried his mother
about [an incident mentioned at some previous
sitting].</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">L. L.</span>&mdash;Was it a mistake?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, tell her, because (etc. etc.). When I
thought it over I knew it was a mistake. If it had
been now, and I had a little more experience in
control, I should not have said so; but it was at
the beginning&mdash;everything seemed such a rush&mdash;and
I was not quite sure of what I did get through.
He did not look at things in the right pers&mdash;perpec&mdash;&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">L. L.</span>&mdash;Perspective?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, that's what he said.</p>

<p>Do you follow me, old chap?</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">L. L.</span>&mdash;Perfectly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">L. L.</span>&mdash;Do you remember a sitting at home when you told
me you had a lot to tell me?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes. What he principally wanted to say was
about the place he is in. He could not <i>spell</i> it all
out&mdash;too laborious. He felt rather upset at first.
You do not feel so real as people do where he is, and
walls appear transparent to him now. The great
thing that made him reconciled to his new surroundings
was&mdash;that things appear so solid and substantial.
The first idea upon waking up was, I suppose,
of what they call 'passing over.' It was only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[ 184]</a></span>
for a second or two, as you count time, [that it
seemed a] shadowy vague place, everything vapoury
and vague. He had that feeling about it.</p>

<p>The first person to meet him was Grandfather.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">(This was said very carefully, as if trying to get
it right with difficulty.)</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>And others then, some of whom he had only
heard about. They all appeared to be so solid, that
he could scarcely believe that he had passed over.</p>

<p>He lives in a house&mdash;a house built of bricks&mdash;and
there are trees and flowers, and the ground is solid.
And if you kneel down in the mud, apparently you
get your clothes soiled. The thing I don't understand
yet is that the night doesn't follow the day here, as
it did on the earth plane. It seems to get dark sometimes,
when he would like it to be dark, but the time
in between light and dark is not always the
same. I don't know if you think all this is a
bore.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">(I was here thinking whether my pencils would
last out; I had two, and was starting on the
second one.)</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>What I am worrying round about is, how it's
made, of what it is composed. I have not found
out yet, but I've got a theory. It is not an original
idea of my own; I was helped to it by words let drop
here and there.</p>

<p>People who think everything is created by thought
are wrong. I thought that for a little time,
that one's thoughts formed the buildings and the
flowers and trees and solid ground; but there is more
than that.</p>

<p>He says something of this sort:&mdash;</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[This means that Feda is going to report in the
third person again, or else to speak for herself.&mdash;O.
J. L.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>There is something always rising from the earth
plane&mdash;something chemical in form. As it rises to
ours, it goes through various changes and solidifies
on our plane. Of course I am only speaking of
where I am now.</p>

<p>He feels sure that it is something given off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[ 185]</a></span>
from the earth, that makes the solid trees and flowers,
etc.</p>

<p>He does not know any more. He is making a
study of this, but it takes a good long time.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">L. L.</span>&mdash;I should like to know whether he can get into touch
with anybody on earth?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Not always.</p>

<p>Only those wishing to see him, and who it would
be right for him to see. Then he sees them before
he has thought.</p>

<p>I don't seem to wish for anything.</p>

<p>He does not wish to see anybody unless they
are going to be brought to him.</p>

<p>I am told that I can meet anyone at any time
that I want to; there is no difficulty in the way of
it. That is what makes it such a jolly fine place
to live in.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">L. L.</span>&mdash;Can he help people here?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>That is part of his work, but there are others
doing that; the greatest amount of his work is
still at the war.</p>

<p>I've been home&mdash;only likely I've been home&mdash;but
my actual work is at the war.</p>

<p>He has something to do with father, though
his work still lies at the war, helping on poor
chaps literally shot into the spirit world.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">L. L.</span>&mdash;Can you see ahead at all?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He thinks sometimes that he can, but it's not
easy to predict.</p>

<p>I don't think that I really know any more
than when on earth.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">L. L.</span>&mdash;Can you tell anything about how the war is going
on?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>There are better prospects for the war. On
all sides now more satisfactory than it has been
before.</p>

<p>This is not apparent on the earth plane, but
I feel more ... the surface, and more satisfied
than before.</p>

<p>I can't help feeling intensely interested. I
believe we have lost Greece, and am not sure
that it was not due to our own fault. We have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[ 186]</a></span>
only done now what should have been done months
ago.</p>

<p>He does not agree about Serbia. Having left
them so long has had a bad effect upon Roumania.
Roumania thinks will she be in the same boat, if
she joins in.</p>

<p>All agree that Russia will do well right through
the winter. They are going to show what they
can do. They are used to their ground and winter
conditions, and Germany is not. There will be
steady progress right through the winter.</p>

<p>I think there is something looming now.</p>

<p>Some of the piffling things I used to be interested
in, I have forgotten all about. There is such
a lot to be interested in here. I realise the
seriousness sometimes of this war.... It is like
watching a most interesting race or game gradually
developing before you. I am doing work in it,
which is not so interesting as watching.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">L. L.</span>&mdash;Have you any message for home?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Of course love to his mother, and to all, specially
to mother. H. is doing very well. [Meaning
his sister Honor.]</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">L. L.</span>&mdash;In what way?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>H. is helping him in a psychic way; she makes it
easy for him. He doesn't think he need tell father
anything, he is so certain in himself meaning
Raymond, in spite of silly mistakes. It disappoints
him. We must separate out the good from the
bad, and not try more than one form; not the
jig&mdash;jig&mdash;&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">L. L.</span>&mdash;I know; jigger. [A kind of Ouija.]</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>No. He didn't like the jigger. He thinks he
can work the table. [See <a href="#Page_217">Chapter XIX</a>.]</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">L. L.</span>&mdash;Would you tell me how I could help in any way?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Just go very easily, only let one person speak,
as he has said before. It can be H. or L. L. Settle
on one person to put the questions, the different
sound of voices confuses him, and he mixes it up
with questions from another's thoughts. In time
he hopes it will be not so difficult. He wouldn't
give it up, he loves it. Don't try more than twice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[ 187]</a></span>
a week, perhaps only once a week. Try to keep the
same times always, and to the same day if possible.</p>

<p>He is going.</p>

<p>Give my love to them all. Tell them I am very
happy. Very well, and plenty to do, and intensely
interested. I did suffer from shock at first, but I'm
extremely happy now.</p>

<p>I'm off. He won't say good-bye.

</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>A lady comes too: A girl, about medium
height; on the slender side, not thin, but slender;
face, oval shape; blue eyes; lightish brown hair,
not golden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">L. L.</span>&mdash;Can she give a name&mdash;I cannot guess who she is
from the description?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>She builds up an L.</p>

<p>Not like the description when she was on earth.
Very little earth life. She is related to you. She
has grown up in the spirit life.</p>

<p>She is fair; not so tall as you; a nice face; blue
eyes.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Give her love to them at home, but also principally
to mother. And say that she and her brother,
not Raymond, have been also to the sittings at
home.</p>

<p>She is giving his name. She gives it in such a
funny way, as if she was writing, so&mdash;&mdash; She
wrote an N, then quickly changed it into a W.
[See also pp. <a href="#Page_134">134</a>,<a href="#Page_159"> 159</a>, and <a href="#Page_190">190</a>.]</p>

<p>She brings lilies with her; she is singing&mdash;it's
like humming; Feda can't hear the words.</p>

<p>She is going too&mdash;power is going.</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A FEW things may be reported from a sitting which
Lady Lodge had with Mrs. Leonard on 26 November,
however absurd they may seem. They are of
course repeated by the childish control Feda, but I do not by
that statement of bare fact intend to stigmatise them in any
way. Criticism of unverifiable utterances seems to me
premature.</p>

<p>The sitting began without preliminaries as usual. It
is not a particularly good one, and the notes are rather
incomplete, especially near the end of the time, when Feda
seemed to wander from the point, and when rather tedious
descriptions of people began. These are omitted.

(The sitting began with a statement from Feda that she
liked Lionel, and that Raymond had taken her down
to his home. Then she reported that Raymond
said:&mdash;)</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>"Mother darling, I am so happy, and so much
more so because you are."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">M. F. A. L.</span>&mdash;Yes, we are; and as your father says, we can
face Christmas now.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">M. F. A. L.</span>&mdash;We will put a chair for him.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, he will come and sit in it.</p>

<p>He wants to strike a bargain with you. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[ 189]</a></span>
says, "If I come there, there must be no sadness.
I don't want to be a ghost at the feast. There
mustn't be one sigh. Please, darling, keep them
in order, rally them up. Don't let them. If they
do, I shall have the hump." (Feda, <i>sotto voce</i>.&mdash;'hump,'
what he say.)</p>
</div>

<p>M. F. A. L.&mdash;We will all drink his health and happiness.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, you can think I am wishing you health too.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -3.5em;">M. F. A. L.&mdash;We were interested in hearing about his
clothes and things; we can't think how he gets
them! [The reference is to a second sitting of
Lionel, not available for publication.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>They are all man-u-fac-tured. [Feda stumbling
over long words.]</p>

<p>Can you fancy you seeing me in white robes?
Mind, I didn't care for them at first, and I wouldn't
wear them. Just like a fellow gone to a country
where there is a hot climate&mdash;an ignorant fellow,
not knowing what he is going to; it's just like that.
He may make up his mind to wear his own clothes
a little while, but he will soon be dressing like the
natives. He was allowed to have earth clothes
here until he got acclimatised; they let him; they
didn't force him. I don't think I will ever be able
to make the boys see me in white robes.</p>

<p>Mother, don't go doing too much.</p>
</div>

<p>M. F. A. L.&mdash;I am very strong.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>You think you are, but you tire yourself out
too much. It troubles me.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -3.5em;">M. F. A. L.&mdash;Yes, but I should be quite glad to come over
there, if I could come quickly, even though I am
so happy here, and I don't want to leave people.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Don't you think I would be glad to have you
here! If you do what he says, you will come over
when the time comes&mdash;quick, sharp.</p>

<p>He says he comes and sees you in bed. The
reason for that is the air is so quiet then. You
often go up there in the spirit-land while your body
is asleep.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -3.5em;">M. F. A. L.&mdash;Would you like us to sit on the same night
as Mrs. Kennedy sits, or on different nights?
[Meaning in trials for cross-correspondences.]</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[ 190]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>On the same night, as it wastes less time. Besides,
he forgets, if there is too long an interval. He
wants to get something of the same sort to each
place.</p>

<p>William and Lily come to play with Raymond.
Lily had gone on, but came back to be with Raymond.
[These mean his long-deceased infant brother and
sister.]</p>
</div>

<p class="center">
(More family talk omitted.)
</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Get some sittings soon, so as to get into full
swing by Christmas. Tell them when they get him
through, and he says, "Raymond," tell them to go
very easily, and not to ask too many questions.
Questions want thinking out beforehand. They are
not to talk among themselves, because then they get
part of one thing and part of another. And not to
say, "No, don't ask him that," or he gets mixed.</p>

<p>Do you know we sometimes have to prepare
answers a little before we transmit them; it is a
sort of mental effort to give answers through the
table. When they say, do you ask, we begin to
get ready to speak through the table. Write down
a few questions and keep to them.</p>

<p class="center"><i>With Some Unverifiable Matter</i>
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AT a sitting which I had with Mrs. Leonard on
3 December 1915, information was given about
the photograph&mdash;as already reported, Chapter IV.
In all these 'Feda' sittings, the remarks styled <i>sotto
voce</i> represent conversation between Feda and the
communicator, not addressed to the sitter at all. I
always try to record these scraps when I can overhear
them; for they are often interesting, and sometimes
better than what is subsequently reported as the result
of the brief conversation. For she appears to be uttering
under her breath not only her own question or comment,
but also what she is being told; and sometimes names
are in that way mentioned correctly, when afterwards
she muddles them. For instance, on one occasion she
said <i>sotto voce</i>, "What you say? Rowland?" (in a
clear whisper); and then, aloud, "He says something like
Ronald." Whereas in this case 'Rowland' proved to be
correct. The dramatically childlike character of Feda
seems to carry with it a certain amount of childish irresponsibility.
Raymond says that he "has to talk to her
seriously about it sometimes."</p>

<p>A few other portions, not about the photograph,
are included in the record of this sitting, some of a
very non-evidential and perhaps ridiculous kind, but I
do not feel inclined to suppress them. (For reasons, see
<a href="#Page_171">Chapter XII</a>.) Some of them are rather amusing. Unverifiable
statements have hitherto been generally suppressed,
in reporting Piper and other sittings; but here,
in deference partly to the opinion of Professor Bergson&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[ 192]</a></span>
who when he was in England urged that statements
about life on the other side, properly studied, like
travellers' tales, might ultimately furnish proof more
logically cogent than was possible from mere access
to earth memories&mdash;they are for the most part reproduced.
I should think, myself, that they are of very
varying degrees of value, and peculiarly liable to unintentional
sophistication by the medium. They cannot
be really satisfactory, as we have no means of bringing
them to book. The difficulty is that Feda encounters
many sitters, and though the majority are just inquirers,
taking what comes and saying very little, one or two
may be themselves full of theories, and may either intentionally
or unconsciously convey them to the 'control';
who may thereafter retail them as actual information,
without perhaps being sure whence they were derived.
Some books, moreover, have been published of late,
purporting to give information about ill-understood things
in a positive and assured manner, and it is possible that
the medium has read these and may be influenced by
them. It will be regrettable if these books are taken as
authoritative by people unable to judge of the scientific
errors which are conspicuous in their more normal portions;
and the books themselves seem likely to retard
the development of the subject in the minds of critical
persons.

<h3><i>Sitting with Mrs. Leonard at her House on Friday,<br />
3 December 1915, from 6.10 p.m. to 8.20 p.m.</i></h3>

<p class="center">(O. J. L. alone.)
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p><i>This is a long record, because I took verbatim notes, but
I propose to inflict it all upon the reader, in accordance with
promise to report unverifiable and possibly absurd matter,
just as it comes, and even to encourage it.</i></p>

<p>Feda soon arrived, said good evening, jerked about
on the chair, and squeaked or chuckled, after her manner
when indicating pleasure. Then, without preliminaries,
she spoke:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He is waiting; he's looking very pleased. He's
awful anxious to tell you about the place where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[ 193]</a></span>
he lives; he doesn't understand <i>yet</i> how it looks
so solid. (Cf. p. <a href="#Page_184">184</a>.)</p>

<p>(Feda, <i>sotto voce</i>.&mdash;What you say? Yes, Feda
knows.) He's been watching lately different kinds
of people what come over, and the different kinds
of effect it has on them.</p>

<p>Oh, it is interesting, he says&mdash;much more than
on the old earth plane. I didn't want to
leave you and mother and all of them, but it
<i>is</i> interesting. I wish you could come over for
one day, and be with me here. There are times
you do go there, but you won't remember. They
have all been over with him at night-time, and so
have you, but he thought it very hard you couldn't
remember. If you did, he is told (he doesn't
know it himself, but he is told this), the brain
would scarcely bear the burden of the double
existence, and would be unfitted for its daily
duties; so the memory is shut out. That is
the explanation given to him.</p>

<p>(Feda, <i>sotto voce</i>.&mdash;What, Raymond? Al&mdash;lec,
he says, Al&mdash;lec, Al&mdash;lec.)</p>

<p>He keeps on saying something about Alec.
He has been trying to get to Alec, to communicate
with him; and he couldn't see if he made himself
felt&mdash;whether he really got through.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">(The medium hitherto had been holding
O. J. L.'s left hand; here she let go, Feda
saying: He will let you have your own
hand back.)</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He thought he had got into a bedroom, and
that he knocked; but there wasn't much notice
taken.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Alec must come here sometime.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, he wanted to see him.</p>

<p>And he also hopes to be able to talk to Lionel
with the direct voice; not here, he says, but somewhere else. He is very anxious to speak
to him. Through a chap, he says, a direct voice chap.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Very well, I will take the message.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[ 194]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Well, he says, he wants to try once or twice.
He wants to be able to say what he says to Feda
in another way. He thinks he could get through
in his own home sometime. He would much rather
have it there. And he thinks that if he got through
once or twice with direct voice, he might be able
to do better in his own home. H. is psychic, he
says, but he is afraid of hurting her; he doesn't
want to take too much from her. But he really is
going to get through. He really has got through
at home; but silly spirits wanted to have a game.
There was a strange feeling there; he didn't seem
to know how much he was doing himself, so he stood
aside part of the time. [Mariemont sittings are
reported later. Chapter <a href="#Page_217">XIX</a>.]</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">
<i>Then the photograph episode came, as reported in
Chapter <a href="#Page_151">IV</a>.</i></span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">Then it went on (Feda talking, of course, all the
time):&mdash;</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He says he has been trying to go to somebody,
and see somebody he used to know. He's not
related to them, and the name begins with S. It's
a gentleman, he says, and he can't remember, or
can't tell Feda the name, but it begins with S. He
was trying to get to them, but is not sure that he
succeeded.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Did he want to?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He says it was only curiosity; but he likes to
feel that he can look up anybody. But he says, if
they take no notice, I shall give up soon, only I just
like to see what it feels like to be looking at them
from where I am.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Does he want to say anything more about his
house or his clothes or his body?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Oh yes. He is bursting to tell you.</p>

<p>He says, my body's very similar to the one I
had before. I pinch myself sometimes to see if it's
real, and it is, but it doesn't seem to hurt as much
as when I pinched the flesh body. The internal
organs don't seem constituted on the same lines as
before. They can't be quite the same. But to all
appearances, and outwardly, they are the same as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[ 195]</a></span>
before. I can move somewhat more freely, he
says.</p>

<p>Oh, there's one thing, he says, I have never
seen anybody bleed.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Wouldn't he bleed if he pricked himself?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He never tried it. But as yet he has seen no
blood at all.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Has he got ears and eyes?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, yes, and eyelashes, and eyebrows, exactly
the same, and a tongue and teeth. He has got a
new tooth now in place of another one he had&mdash;one
that wasn't quite right then. He has got it right,
and a good tooth has come in place of the one
that had gone.</p>

<p>He knew a man that had lost his arm, but he
has got another one. Yes, he has got two arms
now. He seemed as if without a limb when first he
entered the astral, seemed incomplete, but after a
while it got more and more complete, until he got
a new one. He is talking of people who have lost
a limb for some years.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;What about a limb lost in battle?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Oh, if they have only just lost it, it makes
no difference, it doesn't matter; they are quite all
right when they get here. But I am told&mdash;he
doesn't know this himself, but he has been told&mdash;that
when anybody's blown to pieces, it takes some
time for the spirit-body to complete itself, to gather
itself all in, and to be complete. It dissipated a
certain amount of substance which is undoubtedly
theric, theric&mdash;etheric, and it has to be concentrated
again. The <i>spirit</i> isn't blown apart, of
course,&mdash;he doesn't mean that,&mdash;but it has an effect
upon it. He hasn't seen all this, but he has been
inquiring because he is interested.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;What about bodies that are burnt?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Oh, if they get burnt by accident, if they know
about it on this side, they detach the spirit first.
What we call a spirit-doctor comes round and helps.
But bodies should not be burnt on purpose. We
have terrible trouble sometimes over people who
are cremated too soon; they shouldn't be. It's a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[ 196]</a></span>
terrible thing; it has worried me. People are so
careless. The idea seems to be&mdash;"hurry up and
get them out of the way now that they are dead."
Not until seven days, he says. They shouldn't be
cremated for seven days.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;But what if the body goes bad?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>When it goes bad, the spirit is already out. If
that much (indicating a trifle) of spirit is left in the
body, it doesn't start mortifying. It is the action
of the spirit on the body that keeps it from mortifying.
When you speak about a person 'dying upwards,'
it means that the spirit is getting ready and
gradually getting out of the body. He saw the
other day a man going to be cremated two days
after the doctor said he was dead. When his relations
on this side heard about it, they brought a
certain doctor on our side, and when they saw that
the spirit hadn't got really out of the body, they
magnetised it, and helped it out. But there was
still a cord, and it had to be severed rather quickly,
and it gave a little shock to the spirit, like as if you
had something amputated; but it had to be done.
He believes it has to be done in every case. If the
body is to be consumed by fire, it is helped out by
spirit-doctors. He doesn't mean that a spirit-body
comes out of its own body, but an essence comes
out of the body&mdash;oozes out, he says, and goes into
the other body which is being prepared. Oozes,
he says, like in a string. String, that's what he say.
Then it seems to shape itself, or something meets it
and shapes round it. Like as if they met and went
together, and formed a duplicate of the body left
behind. It's all very interesting.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>He told Lionel about his wanting a suit at first
[at an unreported second sitting]. He never thought
that they would be able to provide him with one.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[ 197]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -3.5em;"><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>
&mdash;Yes, I know, Lionel told us; that you wanted
something more like your old clothes at first,
and that they didn't force you into new ones,
but let you begin with the old kind, until you
got accustomed to the place (p. <a href="#Page_189">189</a>).</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, he says, they didn't force me, but most of
the people here wear white robes.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Then, can you tell any difference between men
and women?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>There are men here, and there are women here.
I don't think that they stand to each other quite
the same as they did on the earth plane, but they
seem to have the same feeling to each other, with a
different expression of it. There don't seem to be
any children born here. People are sent into the
physical body to have children on the earth plane;
they don't have them here. But there's a feeling
of love between men and women here which is of a
different quality to that between two men or two
women; and husband and wife seem to meet
differently from mother and son, or father and
daughter. He says he doesn't want to eat now.
But he sees some who do; he says they have to be
given something which has all the appearance of an
earth food. People here try to provide everything
that is wanted. A chap came over the other day,
would <i>would</i> have a cigar. "That's finished them,"
he thought. He means he thought they would
never be able to provide that. But there are
laboratories over here, and they manufacture all
sorts of things in them. Not like you do, out of
solid matter, but out of essences, and ethers,
and gases. It's not the same as on the earth
plane, but they were able to manufacture what
looked like a cigar. He didn't try one himself,
because he didn't care to; you know he wouldn't
want to. But the other chap jumped at it.
But when he began to smoke it, he didn't think
so much of it; he had four altogether, and now
he doesn't look at one.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> They don't seem to get
the same satisfaction out of it, so gradually it
seems to drop from them. But when they first

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[ 198]</a></span>

come they do want things. Some want meat, and some strong drink; they call for whisky sodas.
Don't think I'm stretching it, when I tell you that
they can manufacture even that. But when they
have had one or two, they don't seem to want it
so much&mdash;not those that are near here. He has
heard of drunkards who want it for months and
years over here, but he hasn't seen any. Those
I have seen, he says, don't want it any more&mdash;like
himself with his suit, he could dispense with it
under the new conditions.</p>

<p>He wants people to realise that it's just as
natural as on the earth plane.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Raymond, you said your house was made of
bricks. How can that be? What are the bricks
made of?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>That's what he hasn't found out yet. He is told
by some, who he doesn't think would lead him
astray, that they are made from sort of emanations
from the earth. He says there's something
rising, like atoms rising, and consolidating after
they come; they are not solid when they come,
but we can collect and concentrate them&mdash;I
mean those that are with me. They appear to
be bricks, and when I touch them, they feel like
bricks; and I have seen granite too.</p>

<p>There's something perpetually rising from your
plane; practically invisible&mdash;in atoms when it leaves
your plane&mdash;but when it comes to the ether, it gains
certain other qualities round each atom, and by the
time it reaches us, certain people take it in hand,
and manufacture solid things from it. Just as you
can manufacture solid things.</p>

<p>All the decay that goes on on the earth plane
is not lost. It doesn't just form manure or dust.
Certain vegetable and decayed tissue does form
manure for a time, but it gives off an essence or
a gas, which ascends, and which becomes what
you call a 'smell.' Everything dead has a smell,
if you notice; and I know now that the smell is
of actual use, because it is from that smell that
we are able to produce duplicates of whatever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[ 199]</a></span>
form it had before it became a smell. Even old
wood has a smell different from new wood; you
may have to have a keen nose to detect these
things on the earth plane.</p>

<p>Old rags, he says (<i>sotto voce</i>.&mdash;Yes, all right,
Feda will go back), cloth decaying and going
rotten. Different kinds of cloth give off different
smells&mdash;rotting linen smells different to rotting
wool. You can understand how all this interests
me. Apparently, as far as I can gather, the
rotting wool appears to be used for making things
like tweeds on our side. But I know I am jumping,
I'm guessing at it. My suit I expect was made
from decayed worsted on your side.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Some people here won't take this in even yet&mdash;about
the material cause of all these things. They
go talking about spiritual robes made of light,
built by the thoughts on the earth plane. I
don't believe it. They go about thinking that it is
a thought robe that they're wearing, resulting
from the spiritual life they led; and when we try
to tell them that it is manufactured out of
materials, they don't believe it. They say, "No,
no, it's a robe of light and brightness which I
manufactured by thought." So we just leave it.
But I don't say that they won't get robes quicker
when they have led spiritual lives down there;
I think they do, and that's what makes them
think that they made the robes by their lives.</p>

<p>You know flowers, how they decay. We have
got flowers here; your decayed flowers flower again
with us&mdash;beautiful flowers. Lily has helped me a
lot with flowers.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Do you like her?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, but he didn't expect to see her.</p>

<p>(Feda, <i>sotto voce</i>.&mdash;No. Raymond, you don't
mean that.)</p>

<p>Yes, he does. He says he's afraid he wasn't very
polite to her when he met her at first; he didn't
expect a grown-up sister there. Am I a little
brother, he said, or is she my little sister? She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[ 200]</a></span>
calls me her little brother, but I have a decided
impression that she should be my little sister.</p>

<p>He feels a bit of a mystery: he has got a
brother there he knows, but he says <i>two</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>Sotto voce.</i>&mdash;No, Yaymond, you can't have
two. No, Feda doesn't understand.) Is it possible,
he says, that he has got another brother&mdash;one
that didn't live at all?</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Yes, it is possible.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>But he says, no earth life at all! That's
what's strange. I've seen some one that I am told
is a brother, but I can't be expected to recognise
him, can I? I feel somehow closer to Lily than
I do to that one. By and by I will get to know
him, I dare say.</p>

<p>I'm told that I am doing very well in the short
time I have been here. Taking to it&mdash;what he
say?&mdash;duck to water, he say.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;You know the earth is rolling along through
space. How do you keep up with it?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>It doesn't seem like that to him.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;No, I suppose not. Do you see the stars?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, he sees the stars. The stars seem like
what they did, only he feels closer to them. Not
really closer, but they look clearer; not appreciably
closer, he says.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Are they grouped the same? Do you see the
Great Bear, for instance?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Oh, yes, he sees the Great Bear. And he sees
the ch, ch, chariot, he says.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Do you mean Cassiopeia?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes. [But I don't suppose he did.]</p>

<p>There's one more mystery to him yet, it doesn't
seem day and night quite by regular turns, like
it did on the earth.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;But I suppose you see the sun?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, he sees the sun; but it seems always about
the same degree of warmth, he doesn't feel heat or
cold where he is. The sun doesn't make him
uncomfortably hot. That is not because the
sun has lost its heat, but because he hasn't got
the same body that sensed the heat. When he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[ 201]</a></span>
comes into contact with the earth plane, and is
manifesting, then he feels a little cold or warm&mdash;at
least he does when a medium is present&mdash;not
when he comes in the ordinary way just to
look round. When he sang last night, he felt
cold for a minute or two.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Did he sing?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, he and Paulie had a scuffle. Paulie was
singing first, and Yaymond thought he would
like to sing too, so he chipped in at the end. He
sang about three verses. It wasn't difficult,
because there was a good deal of power there.
Also nobody except Mrs. Kathie knew who he
was, and so all eyes were not on him, and they
were not expecting it, and that made it easier for
him. He says it wasn't so difficult as keeping
up a conversation; he just took the organs there,
and materialised his own voice in her throat. He
didn't find it very difficult, he hadn't got to
think of anything, or collect his ideas; there
was an easy flow of words, and he just sang. And
I <i>did</i> sing, he says; I thought I'd nearly killed the
medium. She hadn't any voice at all after. When
he heard himself that he had really got it, he had
to let go. Raised the roof, he says, and he <i>did</i>
enjoy it!</p>

<p>(Here Feda gave an amused chuckle with a
jump and a squeak.)</p>

<p>He was just practising there, Yaymond says.
At first he thought it wouldn't be easy.</p>

<p>[This relates to what I am told was a real
occurrence at a private gathering; but
it is not evidential.]</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -3.5em;"><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Raymond, you know you want to give me some
proofs. What kind of proofs do you think are
best? Have you talked it over with Mr. Myers,
and have you decided on the kind of proof that
will be most evidential?</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>I don't know yet. I feel divided between
two ways: One is to give you objective proof,
such as simple materialisations and direct voice,
which you can set down and have attested. Or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[ 202]</a></span>
else I should have to give you information
about my different experiences here, either
something like what I am doing now, or through
the table, or some other way. But he doesn't
know whether he will be able to do the two things
together.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;No, not likely, not at the same time. But you
can take opportunities of saying more about your
life there.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, that's why he has been collecting information.
He does so want to encourage people
to look forward to a life they will certainly have
to enter upon, and realise that it is a rational life.
All this that he has been giving you now, and
that I gave to Lionel, you must sort out, and
put in order, because I can only give it
scrappily. I want to study things here a lot.
Would you think it selfish if I say I wouldn't
like to be back now?&mdash;I wouldn't give this up
for anything. Don't think it selfish, or that I
want to be away from you all. I have still
got you, because I feel you so close, closer even.
I wouldn't come back, I wouldn't for anything
that anyone could give me.</p>

<p>He hardly liked to put it that way to his mother.</p>

<p>Is Alec here? (Feda looking round.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;No, but I hope he will be coming.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Tell him not to say who he is. I did enjoy myself
that first time that Lionel came&mdash;I could talk
for hours.</p>
</div>

<p>(O. J. L. had here looked at his watch quietly.)</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>I could talk for hours; don't go yet.</p>

<p>He says he thinks he was lucky when he passed
on, because he had so many to meet him. That
came, he knows now, through your having been in
with this thing for so long. He wants to impress
this on those that you will be writing for: that it
makes it so much easier for them if they and their
friends know about it beforehand. It's awful when
they have passed over and won't believe it for
weeks,&mdash;they just think they're dreaming. And
they won't realise things at all sometimes. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[ 203]</a></span>
doesn't mind telling you now that, just at first,
when he woke up, he felt a little depression. But
it didn't last long. He cast his eyes round, and soon
he didn't mind. But it was like finding yourself in a
strange place, like a strange city; with people you
hadn't seen, or not seen for a long time, round you.
Grandfather was with me straight away; and
presently Robert. I got mixed up between two
Roberts. And there's some one called Jane comes
to him, who calls herself an aunt, he says. Jane.
He's uncertain about her. Jane&mdash;Jennie. She
calls herself an aunt; he is told to call her 'Aunt
Jennie.' Is she my Aunt Jennie? he says.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;No, but your mother used to call her that.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>[And so on, simple talk about family and friends.]</p>

<p>He has brought that doggie again, nice doggie.
A doggie that goes like this, and twists about
(Feda indicating a wriggle). He has got a nice tail,
not a little stumpy tail, nice tail with nice hair on it.
He sits up like that sometimes, and comes down
again, and puts his tongue out of his mouth. He's
got a cat too, plenty of animals, he says. He hasn't
seen any lions and tigers, but he sees horses, cats,
dogs, and birds. He says you know this doggie;
he has nice hair, a little wavy, which sticks up
all over him, and has twists at the end. Now he's
jumping round. He hasn't got a very pointed face,
but it isn't like a little pug-dog either; it's rather
a long shape. And he has nice ears what flaps,
not standing up; nice long hairs on them too.
A darkish colour he looks, darkish, as near as Feda
can see him. [See photograph, p. 278.]</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Does he call him by any name?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He says, 'Not him.'</p>

<p>(<i>Sotto voce.</i>&mdash;What you mean 'not him'? It
is a 'him'; you don't call him 'it.')</p>

<p>No, he won't explain. No, he didn't give it a
name. It can jump.</p>

<p>[All this about a she-dog called Curly, whose
death had been specially mentioned by
'Myers' through another medium some
years ago,&mdash;an incident reported privately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[ 204]</a></span>
to the S.P.R. at the time,&mdash;is quite good as
far as it goes.]</p>

<p>He has met a spirit here, he says, who knows
you&mdash;G. Nothing to do with the other G. Some
one that's a very fine sort indeed. His name begins
with G&mdash;Gal, Gals, Got, Got,&mdash;he doesn't know
him very well, but it sounds like that. It isn't who
you feel, though it might have been, nothing to do
with that at all. Some one called Golt&mdash;he didn't
know him, but he is interested in you, and had
met you.</p>

<p>It's surprising how many people come up to
me, he says, and shake me by the hand, and speak
to me. I don't know them from Adam. (<i>Sotto
voce</i>.&mdash;Adam, he say.) But they are doing me
honour here, and some of them are such fine men.
He doesn't know them, but they all seem to be interested
in you, and they say, "Oh, are you his son?&mdash;how-do-you-do?"</p>

<p>Feda is losing control.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Well, good-bye, Raymond, then, and God bless
you.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>God bless <i>you</i>.&nbsp; I do so want you to know that I
am very happy.&nbsp; And bless them all.&nbsp; My love to
you.&nbsp; I can't tell what I feel, but you can guess.&nbsp;
It's difficult to put into words.&nbsp; My love to all.
God bless you and everybody.&nbsp; Good-bye,&nbsp; father.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Good-bye,&nbsp; Raymond.&nbsp; Good-bye,&nbsp; Feda.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>(Feda here gave a jerk, and a 'good-bye.')</p>

<p>Love to her what 'longs to you, and to Lionel.
Feda knows what your name is, 'Soliver,' yes.
(Another squeak.)</p>
</div>

<p class="center">(<i>Sitting ended 8.20 p.m.</i>)</p>

<p>The conclusion of sittings is seldom of an evidential
character, and by most people would not be recorded;
but occasionally it may be best to quote one completely,
just as a specimen of what may be called the 'manner'
of a sitting.</p>

I confess that I think that Feda may have got a great deal
of this, perhaps all of it, from people who have read or written some of
the books referred to in my introductory remarks. But inasmuch as her
other utterances are often evidential, I feel that I have no right to
pick and choose; <i>especially as I know nothing about it, one way or

<span class="small">FIRST SITTING OF ALEC WITH MRS. LEONARD</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON 21 December 1915 Alec had his first sitting with
Mrs. Leonard; but he did not manage to go quite
anonymously&mdash;the medium knew that he was my
son. Again there is a good deal of unverifiable matter,
which whether absurd or not I prefer not to suppress; my
reasons are indicated in Chapters xii and xvi Part II,
and xi Part III.
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h3><i>Alec's (A. M. L.'s) Sitting with Mrs. Leonard at her House<br />
on Tuesday Afternoon, 21 December 1915, 3.15 to 4.30 p.m.</i></h3>

<p class="center">(Medium knows I am Sir Oliver Lodge's son.)
<br />
<br />
</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Front room; curtains drawn; dark; small red lamp.
No one else present.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leonard shook hands saying, "Mr. Lodge?"</p>

<p>(Medium begins by rubbing her own hands vigorously.)</p>

<p>Good morning! This is Feda.</p>

<p>Raymond's here. He would have liked A
<i>and</i> B.</p>

<p>(Feda, <i>sotto voce</i>.&mdash;What you mean, A <i>and</i> B?)</p>

<p>Oh, he would have liked to talk to A and B.
[See <a href="#Page_212">Note A</a>.] He says: "I wish you could see
me, I am so pleased; but you know I am pleased."</p>

<p>He has been trying hard to get to you at home.
He thinks he is getting closer, and better able
to understand the conditions which govern this
way of communicating. He thinks that in a
little while he will be able to give actual tests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[ 209]</a></span>
at home. He knows he has got through, but not
satisfactorily. He gets so far, and then flounders.</p>

<p>(Feda, <i>sotto voce</i>.&mdash;That's what fishes do!)</p>

<p>He says he is feeling splendid. He did not
think it was possible to feel so well.</p>

<p>He was waiting here; he knew you were
coming, but thought you might not be able to
come to-day. [Train half an hour late.]</p>

<p>Did you take notice of what he said about
the place he is in?</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A. M. L.</span>&mdash;Yes. But I find it very difficult to understand.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He says, it is such a solid place, I have not
got over it yet. It is so wonderfully real.</p>

<p>He spoke about a river to his father; he has
not seen the sea yet. He has found water, but
doesn't know whether he will find a sea. He is
making new discoveries every day. So <i>much</i>
is new, although of course not to people who
have been here some time.</p>

<p>He went into the library with his grandfather&mdash;Grandfather
William&mdash;and also somebody
called Richard, and he says the books there
seem to be the same as you read.</p>

<p>Now this is extraordinary: There are books
there not yet published on the earth plane. He
is told&mdash;only told, he does not know if it is correct&mdash;that
those books will be produced, books like
those that are there now; that the matter in them
will be impressed on the brain of some man, he
supposes an author.</p>

<p>He says that not everybody on his plane is
allowed to read those books; they might hurt
them&mdash;that is, the books not published yet. Father
is going to write one&mdash;not the one on now, but a
fresh one.</p>

<p>Has his father found out who it was, beginning
with G, who said he was going to help
(meaning help Raymond) for his father's sake?
It was not the person he thought it was at the
time (p. <a href="#Page_204">204</a>).</p>

<p>It is very difficult to get things through. He
wants to keep saying how pleased he is to come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[ 210]</a></span></p>

<p>There are hundreds of things he will think of after he is gone.</p>

<p>He has brought Lily, and William&mdash;the young one&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>(Feda, <i>sotto voce</i>.&mdash;I don't know whether it is
right, but he appears to have two brothers.)</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[Two brothers as well as a sister died in extreme
infancy. He would hardly know that,
normally.&mdash;O. J. L.]</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A. M. L.</span>&mdash;Feda, will you ask Raymond if he would like
me to ask some questions?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, with pleasure, he says.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -3.5em;"><span class="smcap">A. M. L.</span>&mdash;A little time ago,
Raymond said he was with mother. Mother would like to know if he can say
what she was doing when he came? Ask Raymond
to think it over, and see if he can remember?</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, yes. She'd got some wool and scissors.
She had a square piece of stuff&mdash;he is showing
me this&mdash;she was working on the square piece
of stuff. He shows me that she was cutting
the wool with the scissors.</p>

<p>Another time, she was in bed.</p>

<p>She was in a big chair&mdash;dark covered&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>This refers to the time mentioned first. [<a href="#Page_214">Note B</a>.]</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A. M. L.</span>&mdash;Ask Raymond if he can remember which
room she was in?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p>He can't remember. He can't always see
more than a corner of the room&mdash;it appears
vapourish and shadowy.</p>

<p>He often comes when you're in bed.</p>

<p>He tried to call out loudly: he shouted,
'Alec, Alec!' but he didn't get any answer.
That is what puzzles him. He thinks he has
shouted, but apparently he has not even manufactured
a whisper.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -3.5em;"><span class="smcap">A. M. L.</span>&mdash;Feda, will you ask
Raymond if he can remember trivial things that happened, as these
things often make the best tests?</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He says he can now and again.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -3.5em;"><span class="smcap">A. M. L.</span>&mdash;The questions that

but make good tests, as father knows nothing about them.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, Raymond quite understands. He is just
as keen as you are to give those tests.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A. M. L.</span>&mdash;Ask Raymond if the word 'Evinrude' in connexion

message simultaneously:&mdash;)</p>

<p>He says something burst.</p>

am quite sure he gets things
through occasionally, but that I think often the
meaning comes through altered, and very often
appears to be affected by the sitter. It appears
to me that they usually get what they expect.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Raymond says, "I only wish they did!" But
in a way you are right. He is never able to give
all he wishes. Sometimes only a word, which
often must appear quite disconnected. Often the
word does not come from his mind; he has no trace
of it. Raymond says, for this reason it is a good
thing to try, more, to come and give something
definite at home. When you sit at the table, he
feels sure that what he wants to say is influenced
by some one at the table. Some one is helping
him, some one at the table is guessing at the words.
He often starts a word, but somebody finishes it.</p>

<p>He asked father to let you come and not say who
you were; he says it would have been a bit of fun.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A. M. L.</span>&mdash;Ask Raymond if he can remember any characteristic
things we used to talk about among ourselves?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[ 212]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes. He says you used to talk about cars.</p>

<p>(Feda, <i>sotto voce</i>.&mdash;What you mean? Everybody
talks about cars!)</p>

<p>And singing. He used to fancy he could sing.
He didn't sing hymns. On Thursday nights he has
to sing hymns, but they are not in his line.</p>

<p>[On Thursday nights I am told that a circle
holds sittings for developing the direct voice

<h3><span class="smcap">Notes by O. J. L. on the A. M. L. Record</span></h3>

<p>This seems to have been a good average sitting; it
contains a few sufficiently characteristic remarks, but not
much evidential. What is said about songs in it, however,
is rather specially good. In further explanation, a
few notes, embodying more particular information obtained
by me from the family when reading the sitting
over to them, may now be added:&mdash;
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h4>NOTE A</h4>

<p>The 'A <i>and</i> B' manifestly mean his brothers Alec and Brodie;
and there was a natural reason for bracketing them together,
inasmuch as they constitute the firm Lodge Brothers, with which
Raymond was already to a large extent, and hoped to be still
more closely, associated. But there may have been a minor point
in it, since between Alec and Brodie long ago, at their joint preparatory
school, there was a sort of joke, of which Raymond was
aware, about problems given in algebra and arithmetic books:
where, for instance, A buys so many dozen at some price, and
B buys some at another price; the question being to compare their
profits. Or where A does a piece of work in so many days, and
B does something else. It is usually not at all obvious, without
working out, which gets the better of it, A or B; and Alec seems
to have recognised, in the manner of saying A and B, some reference
to old family chaff on this subject.
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h4>NOTE B</h4>

<p>The reference to a square piece of stuff, cut with scissors,
suggests to his mother, not the wool-work which she is doing like
everybody else for soldiers, but the cutting of a circular piece out
of a Raymond blanket that came back with his kit, for the purpose
of covering a round four-legged table which was subsequently used
for sittings, in order to keep it clean without its having to be
dusted or otherwise touched by servants. It is not distinct enough
to be evidential, however.
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h4>NOTE C</h4>

<p>About Dartmoor, "he says something burst." Incidents
referred to in a previous sitting, when I was there alone, were the
running downhill, clapping on brake, and swirling round corners
(p. <a href="#Page_156">156</a>); but all this was associated with, and partly caused by,
the bursting of the silencer in the night after the hilly country
had been reached. And it was the fearful noise subsequent to
the bursting of the silencer that the boys had expected him to
remember.
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[ 215]</a></span></p>

<h4>NOTE D</h4>

<p>The best evidential thing, however, is on p. <a href="#Page_212">212</a>&mdash;a reference
to a song of his called "My Orange Girl." If the name of the
song merely had been given, though good enough, it would not
have been quite so good, because the name of a song is common
property. But the particular mode of describing it, in such a
way as to puzzle Feda, namely, "an orange lady," making her
think rather of a market woman, is characteristic of Raymond&mdash;especially
the sentence about "extolling her virtues and beauties,"
which is not at all appropriate to Feda, and is exactly like Raymond.
So is "Willie of the weary proclivities."</p>

<p>The song "Irish Eyes" was also, I find, quite correct. It
seems to have been a comparatively recent song, which he had
sung several times.</p>

<p>Again, the song described thus by Feda:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A funny song which starts Ma. But Feda can't see any
more&mdash;like somebody's name."</p>

<p>I find that the letters M A were pronounced separately&mdash;not
as a word. To me the <span class="smcap">Ma</span> had suggested one of those nigger
songs about 'Ma Honey'&mdash;the kind of song which may have
been indicated by the word 'Hottentot' above. But, at a later
table sitting at Mariemont, he was asked what song he meant by
the letters M A, and then he spelt out clearly the name 'Maggie.'
This song was apparently unknown to those at the table, but
was recognised by Norah, who was in the room, though not at
the table, as a still more recent song of Raymond's, about "Maggie
Magee." (See Appendix also.)</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Appendix to Sitting of 21 December 1915</span></h3>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Written 3-1/2 Months later</span>)</p>

<p class="center">(Dictated by O. J. L., 12 April 1916.)
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>Last night the family were singing over some songs,
and came across one which is obviously the one referred
to in the above sitting of A. M. L. with Mrs. Leonard,
held nearly four months ago, of which a portion ran thus
(just before the reference to Orange Girl):&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">A. M. L.</span>&mdash;What used he to sing?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Hello&mdash;Hullalo&mdash;sounds like Hullulu,&mdash;Hullulo.
Something about 'Hottentot'; but he is
going back a long way, he thinks."</p>
</div>

<p>References to other songs known to the family
followed, but this reference to an unknown song was
vaguely remembered by the family as a puzzle;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[ 216]</a></span>
and it existed in A. M. L.'s mind as "a song about
'Honolulu,'"&mdash;this being apparently the residual impression
produced by the 'Hullulu' in combination with
'Hottentot'; but no Honolulu song was known.</p>

<p>A forgotten and overlooked song has now (11 April
1916) turned up, which is marked in pencil "R. L. 3.3.4.,"
<i>i.e.</i> 3 March 1904, which corresponds to his "going back a
long way"&mdash;to a time, in fact, when he was only fifteen.
It is called, "My Southern Maid"; and although no word
about 'Honolulu' occurs in the printed version, one of the
verses has been altered in Raymond's writing in pencil;
and that alteration is the following absurd introduction
to a noisy chorus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem width24">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Any little flower from a tulip to a rose,</p>
<p>If you'll be Mrs. John James Brown</p>
<p>Of Hon-o-lu-la-lu-la town."</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Until these words were sung last night, nobody seems
to have remembered the song "My Southern Maid," and
there appears to be no reason for associating it with the
word 'Honolulu' or any similar sound, so far as public
knowledge was concerned, or apart from Raymond's
alterations.</p>

<p>Alec calls attention to the fact that, in answer to his
question about songs, no songs were mentioned which were
not actually Raymond's songs; and that those which
were mentioned were not those he was expecting. Furthermore,
that if he had thought of these songs he would have
thought of them by their ordinary titles, such as "My
Orange Girl" and "My Southern Maid"; though the
latter he had forgotten altogether.</p>

<p>(A sort of disconnected sequel to this song episode
occurred some months later, as reported in <a href="#Page_271">Chapter
XXIII</a>.)</p>

<h2><span class="gesperrt">CHAPTER XIX</span><br />
<span class="small">PRIVATE SITTINGS AT MARIEMONT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">It had been several times indicated that Raymond
wanted to come into the family circle at home, and
that Honor, whom he often refers to as H., would be
able to help him. Attempted private sittings of this kind
were referred to by Raymond through London mediums,
and he gave instruction as to procedure, as already
reported (pp. <a href="#Page_160">160</a> and <a href="#Page_190">190</a>).</p>

<p>After a time some messages were received, and family
communications without any outside medium have gradually
become easy.</p>

<p>Records were at first carefully kept, but I do not report
them, because clearly it is difficult to regard anything
thus got as evidential. At the same time, the naturalness
of the whole, and the ready way in which family jokes
were entered into and each new-comer recognised and
welcomed appropriately, were very striking. A few incidents,
moreover, were really of an evidential character,
and these must be reported in due course.</p>

<p>But occasionally the table got rather rampageous and
had to be quieted down. Sometimes, indeed, both the
table and things like flower-pots got broken. After these
more violent occasions, Raymond volunteered the explanation,
through mediums in London, that he couldn't always
control it, and that there was a certain amount of skylarking,
not on our side, which he tried to prevent (see
pp. <a href="#Page_182">182</a>, <a href="#Page_194">194</a> and <a href="#Page_273">273</a>); though in certain of the surprising
mechanical demonstrations, and, so to speak, tricks, which
certainly seemed beyond the normal power of anyone
touching the table, he appeared to be decidedly interested,
and was represented as desirous of repeating a few of the
more remarkable ones for my edification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[ 218]</a></span></p>

<p>I do not, however, propose to report in this book concerning
any purely physical phenomena. They require a
more thorough treatment. Suffice it to say that the movements
were not only intelligent, but were sometimes,
though very seldom, such as apparently could not be
accomplished by any normal application of muscular force,
however unconsciously such force might be exerted by
anyone&mdash;it might only be a single person&mdash;left in contact
with the table.</p>

<p>A family sitting with no medium present is quite
different from one held with a professional or indeed any
outside medium. Information is freely given about the
doings of the family; and the general air is that of a family
conversation; because, of course, in fact, no one but the
family is present.</p>

<p>At any kind of sitting the conversation is rather one-sided,
but whereas with a medium the sitter is reticent, and
the communicator is left to do nearly all the talking, in a
family group the sitters are sometimes voluble; while the
ostensible control only occasionally takes the trouble to
spell out a sentence, most of his activity consisting in
affirmation and negation and rather effective dumb show.</p>

<p>I am reluctant to print a specimen of these domestic
chats, though it seems necessary to give some account of
them.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day, 1915, the family had a long table
sitting. It was a friendly and jovial meeting, with plenty
of old songs interspersed, which he seemed thoroughly to
enjoy and, as it were, 'conduct'; but for publication I
think it will be better to select something shorter, and I
find a description written by one to whom such things
were quite new except by report&mdash;a lady who had been
governess in the family for many years, when even the
elder children were small, and long before Raymond was
born. This lady, Miss F. A. Wood, commonly called
'Woodie' from old times, happened to be staying on a
visit to Mariemont in March 1916, and was present at two
or three of the family sittings. She was much interested
in her first experience, and wrote an account immediately
afterwards, which, as realistically giving the impression of
a witness, I have obtained her permission to copy here.</p>

<p>At this date the room was usually considerably darkened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[ 219]</a></span>
for a sitting; but even partial darkness was unnecessary,
and was soon afterwards dispensed with, especially as
it interfered with easy reading of music at the piano.</p>

<h3><i>Table Sitting in the Drawing-room at Mariemont,<br />
Thursday, 2 March 1916, about 6 p.m.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Sitters</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lady Lodge</span>,
<span class="smcap">Norah</span>, and <span class="smcap">Woodie</span>; later, <span class="smcap">Honor</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Report by Miss F. A. Wood</i>
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>As it was the first time that I had ever been at a sitting of any
kind, I shall put down the details as fully as I can remember
them.</p>

<p>The only light in the room was from the gas-fire, a large one,
so that we could see each other and things in the room fairly
distinctly; the table used at this time was a rather small octagonal
one, though weighty for its size, with strong centre stem, supported
on three short legs, top like a chess-board. Lady Lodge sat with
her back to window looking on to drive, Norah with back to
windows looking on to tennis-lawn, and I, Woodie, had my back
to the sofa.</p>

<p>As we were about to sit down, Lady Lodge said: "We
always say a little prayer first."</p>

<p>I had hoped that she intended to pray aloud for us all, but
she did it silently, so I did the same, having been upstairs before
and done this also.</p>

<p>For some time nothing whatever happened. I only felt that
the table was keeping my hands extremely cold.</p>

<p>After about half an hour, Lady Lodge said: "I don't think
that anyone is coming to-night; we will wait just a little longer,
and then go."</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -3.5em;"><span class="smcap">Lady Lodge</span>.&mdash;Is anyone
here to-night to speak to us? Do come if you can, because we want to show Woodie what a sitting
is like. Raymond, dear, do you think you could come to us?</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>(No answer.)</p>
</div>

<p>During the half-hour before Lady Lodge asked any
questions I had felt every now and then a curious tingling
in my hands and fingers, and then a much stronger drawing
sort of feeling through my hands and arms, which caused
the table to have a strange intermittent trembling sort of
feeling, though it was not a movement of the <i>whole</i> table.
Another 'feeling' was as if a 'bubble' of the table came
up, and tapped gently on the palm of my left hand. At
first I only felt it once; after a short interval three times;
then a little later about twelve times. And once (I shall
not be able to explain this) I felt rather than heard a faint
tap in the centre of the table (away from people's hands).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[ 220]</a></span></p>

<p>Nearly every time I felt these queer movements Lady
Lodge asked, "Did you move, Woodie?" I had certainly
not done so consciously, and said so, and while I was
feeling that 'drawing' feeling through hands and arms, I
said nothing myself, till Lady Lodge and Norah both said,
"What <i>is</i> the table doing? It has never done like this
before." Then I told of my strange feelings in hands and
arms, etc. Lady Lodge said it must be due to nerves, or
muscles, or something of the sort. These strange feelings
did not last long at a time, and generally, but not always,
they came after Lady Lodge had asked questions (to some
one on the other side).</p>

<p>After a bit, when the 'feelings' had gone from me at
least, Lady Lodge suggested Norah's going for Honor,
who came, but said on first sitting down that the
table felt dead, and she did not think that anyone was
there.</p>


<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -3.5em;"><span class="smcap">Lady L.</span>&mdash;Is anyone coming?
We should be so pleased if anyone
could; we have been sitting here some time very
patiently.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Nothing happened for a bit, and Lady Lodge said, "I
don't think it is any good."</p>

<p>But I said, "Oh, do wait a little longer, that tingling
feeling is coming back again."</p>

<p>And Honor said, "Yes, I think there is something."</p>

<p>And then the table began to move, and Lady Lodge
asked:&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady L.</span>&mdash;Raymond, darling, is that you?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>(The table rocked three times.)
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady L.</span>&mdash;That is good of you, because Woodie did so want you
to come.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>(The table rocked to and fro with a pleased motion,
most difficult to express on paper.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Woodie.</span>&mdash;Do you think that I have any power?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">No.</span>

Bill, too.</span></p>

<p>(Raymond seemed very pleased when Brother Bill was
mentioned.)</p>

<p>(The table now seemed to wish to get into Lady Lodge's
lap, and made most caressing movements to and fro, and
seemed as if it could not get close enough to her.</p>

<p>Soon we realised that he was wanting to go, so we asked
him if this was so, and he said:&mdash;)</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">Yes.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>(So we said 'good night' to him, and after giving two
rather slight movements, which I gather is what he generally
does just as he is going, we said 'good night' once
more, and came away.)</p>

<p>One other family sitting, a still shorter one, may be
quoted as a specimen also; though out of place. A
question asked was suggested by something reported on
page 230. It appears that Miss Wood was still here, but
that on this occasion she was not one of those that
touched the table.</p>

<p>At this date the table generally used happened to be
a chess-table with centre pillar and three claw feet. After
this table and another one had got broken during the
more exuberant period of these domestic sittings, before
the power had got under control, a stronger and heavier
round table with four legs was obtained, and employed
only for this purpose.

<h3><i>Table Sitting in the Drawing-Room at Mariemont,<br />
9 p.m., Monday, 17 April 1916</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Report by M. F. A. L.</span></h4>

<p>Music going on in the drawing-room at Mariemont.</p>

<p>The girls (four of them) and Alec singing at the
piano. Woodie and Honor and I sitting at the other
end of the room. Lionel in the large chair.</p>

<p>The Shakespeare Society was meeting in the
house, and at that time having coffee in the dining-room,
so O. J. L. was not with us.</p>

<p>Woodie thought Raymond was in the room and
would like to hear the singing, but Honor thought
it too late to begin with the table, as we should shortly
be going into the dining-room.</p>

<p>However, I got the table ready near the piano,
and Honor came to it, and the <i>instant</i> she placed
her hands on it, it began to rock. I put my hands
on too.</p>

<p>We asked if it was Raymond, and if he had been
waiting, and he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">Yes.</span></p>
</div>

<p>He seemed to wish to listen to the music, and kept
time with it gently. And after a song was over
that he liked, he very distinctly and decidedly applauded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[ 223]</a></span></p>

<p>Lionel came (I think at Raymond's request) and
sat at the table with us. It was determined to
edge itself close to the piano, though we said we
must pull it back, and did so. But it would go
there, and thumped Barbie, who was playing the
piano, in time to the music. Alec took one of the
black satin cushions and held it against her as a
buffer. The table continued to bang, and made a
little hole in the cushion.</p>

<p>It then edged itself along the floor, where for
a minute or two it could make a sound on the boards
beyond the carpet. Then it seemed to be feeling
about with one foot (it has three).</p>

<p>It found a corner of the skirting board, where
it could lodge one foot about 6 inches from the
ground. It then raised the other three level with
it, in the air; and this it did many times, seeming
delighted with its new trick.</p>

<p>It then laid itself down on the ground, and we
asked if we should help it and lift it up, but it
banged a</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">No</span></p>
</div>

<p>on the floor, and raised itself a little several times
without having the strength to get up. It lifted
itself quite a foot from the ground, and was again
asked if we might not lift it, but it again banged
once for</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">No.</span></p>
</div>

<p>But Lionel then said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">LIONEL.</span>&mdash;Well, Pat, my hand is in a most uncomfortable
position; won't you let me put the table up?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>It at once banged three times for</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">Yes.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>So we raised it.</p>

<p>I then said:&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">M. F. A. L.</span>&mdash;Raymond, I want to ask you a question as a
test: What is the name of the sphere on which you are living?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[I did this, because others beside Raymond have
said, through Mrs. Leonard, that they were living on the third sphere, and that it was
called 'Summerland,' so I thought it might be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[ 224]</a></span>
an idea of the medium's.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> I don't much like
these 'sphere' messages, and don't know whether they mean anything; but I assume
that 'sphere' may mean condition, or state of development.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>We took the alphabet, and the answer came at
once:&mdash;</p>
</div>

<h3>SUMMERRLODGE.</h3>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>We asked, after the second R, if there was not
some mistake; and again when O came, instead of
the A we had expected for 'Summerland.'</p>

<p>But he said No.</p>

<p>So we went on, though I thought it was hopelessly
wrong, and ceased to follow. I felt sure it was mere
muddle.</p>

<p>So my surprise was the greater when the note-taker
read out, 'Summer R. Lodge,' and I found
he had signed his name to it, to show, I suppose,
that it was his own statement, and not Feda's.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[Lorna reports that the impression made upon
them was that Raymond knew they had been
expecting one ending, and that he was amused
at having succeeded in giving them another.
They enjoyed the joke together, and the table
shook as if laughing.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>We talked to him a little after this, and Alec
and No�l put their hands on the table, and we said
good night.</p>
</div>

<p>It is only necessary to add that the mechanical movements
here described are <i>not</i> among those which, on page
218, I referred to as physically unable to be done by muscular
effort on the part of anyone whose hands are only on
the table top. I am not in this book describing any cases
of that sort. Whatever was the cause of the above mechanical
trick movements, which were repeated on a subsequent
occasion for my observation, the circumstances were not
strictly evidential. I ought to say, however, that most certainly
I am sure that no <i>conscious</i> effort was employed by
anyone present.</p>

<h3>WARNING</h3>

<p>It may be well to give a word of warning to those who
find that they possess any unusual power in the psychic
direction, and to counsel regulated moderation in its use.
Every power can be abused, and even the simple faculty of
automatic writing can with the best intentions be misapplied.
Self-control is more important than any other
form of control, and whoever possesses the power of receiving
communications in any form should see to it that
he remains master of the situation. To give up your own
judgement and depend solely on adventitious aid is a grave
blunder, and may in the long run have disastrous consequences.
Moderation and common sense are required in
those who try to utilise powers which neither they nor any
fully understand, and a dominating occupation in mundane
affairs is a wholesome safeguard.</p>

<h2><span class="gesperrt">CHAPTER XX</span><br />
<span class="small">A FEW MORE RECORDS, WITH SOME<br />
UNVERIFIABLE MATTER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">AFTER Christmas I had proposed to drop the historical
order and make selections as convenient, but I
find that sequence must to some extent be maintained,
because of the inter-locking of sittings with different mediums
and development generally. I shall, however, only
preserve historical order so far as it turns out useful or
relevant, and will content myself with reporting that on 3
January 1916 Raymond's eldest sister, Violet (the one married
to the 'Rowland' that he mentioned through Feda), had
a good sitting with him, and was not only recognised easily,
but knowledge was shown of much that she had been doing,
and of what she was immediately planning to do. Reference
was also made by Raymond to what he called his special
room in her house (p. <a href="#Page_45">45</a>); and, later, he said that that room
was bare of furniture, which it was.</p>

<p>And at some of the sittings now, deceased friends, not
relatives, were brought by Raymond, and gave notable evidence
both to us and to other people; especially to parents
in some cases, to widows in others; some of which may
perhaps be partially reported hereafter.</p>

<p>I propose now to pass on to some unverifiable matter
(see Chapters <a href="#Page_171">XII</a> and <a href="#Page_191">XVI</a>), and especially to a strange
and striking sitting which Lady Lodge had with Mrs.
Leonard on 4 February 1916.</p>

<p>This may as well be reported almost in full, in spite
of unimportant and introductory portions, since it seems
fairer to give the context, especially of unverifiable matter.
But I feel bound to say that there is divergence of opinion
as to whether this particular record ought to be published
or not. I can only say that I recognise the responsibility,
and hope that I am right in partially accepting it.

<h3><i>Non-Evidential Sitting of M. F. A. L. with Mrs. Leonard<br />
at her House on Friday, 4 February 1916,<br />
from 8.30 p.m. to 11.10 p.m.</i></h3>

<p class="center">(M. F. A. L. alone.)
<br />
<br />
</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Feda.&mdash;Oh, it's Miss Olive!</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">M. F. A. L.</span>&mdash;So glad to meet you, Feda!</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Feda love you and Soliver best of all. SLionel
and SAlec too she love very much.</p>

<p>Yaymond is here. He has been all over the place
with Paulie, to all sorts of places to the mediums, to
try and get poor boys into touch with their mothers.
Some are very jealous of those who succeed. They
try to get to their mothers, and they can't&mdash;they are
shut out. They make me feel as though I could cry
to see them. We explain that their mothers and
fathers don't know about communicating. They say,
why don't they all go to mediums?</p>

<p>Yaymond say, it makes me wonder too.</p>

<p>He say, he was telling Feda, it was awful funny
the things some of them did&mdash;it has a funny side,
going to see the mediums. You see, Paul and he
couldn't help having a joke; they are boys themselves,
laughing over funny things.</p>

<p>He says he was listening to Paul, and he was
describing the drawing-room at home. (A good
description was now given of the drawing-room at
Mariemont, which the medium had never seen.)</p>

<p>Feda sees flowers; they're Feda's, not Gladys's.</p>

<p>[M. F. A. L. had brought flowers for Mrs. Leonard.]</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">M. F. A. L.</span>&mdash;Don't you have flowers, then?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, lots of flowers. But Feda like to have
them in Gladys's room. [Apparently this must be
Mrs. Leonard's name.]</p>

<p>There's a lot in prayer. Prayer keeps out evil
things, and keeps nice clean conditions. Raymond
says, keeps out devils.</p>

<p>Mother, I don't want to talk about material things,
but to satisfy anxiety. I was very uneasy on Monday
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[ 228]</a></span>
night. I tried to come near, but there was a
band round me. We were all there.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">M. F. A. L.</span>&mdash;The Zeppelins did come on Monday night, but
they did not touch us. [We went to bed and didn't
worry about them.]</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He says, they worked in a circular way, east and
south of you. Awful! He hoped it wouldn't upset
you; he didn't want them to come too close. I
know you're not nervous, but I fear for you. If
he'd been on the earth plane, he'd have been flying
home. He says <i>New Street</i> was the mark.</p>

<p>Some one called 'M.' sent you a message through
Mrs. F. (?), and wanted her dearest love given.
She's had to be away rather from the earth plane
for some time, but he actually has seen M. several
times. Conditions of war have brought her back.
She had progressed a good way. She wondered if
you realised it was not her will to leave you so long,
but progression. She belongs to a higher plane.</p>

<p>M. knew something about this before she passed
on, though perhaps it makes it easier to be always
communicating.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[Some friends will know for whom this is intended&mdash;a
great friend of our and many
other children. She had had one sitting with
Mrs. Piper at Mariemont, not a good one.&mdash;O.
J. L.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Her life on the earth plane made it easier for her
to go on quickly after she passed out.</p>

<p>(Feda, <i>sotto voce</i>.&mdash;What you say?)</p>

<p>M. says, it will be a test, that she was with his
father at a medium's, where she saw a control
named Alice Anne, a little girl control; she didn't
speak to Soliver, but was with him at the medium's.
"The old Scotch girl" what Paulie calls her; old
Scotch lady&mdash;same thing.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[This is correct about a sitting with Miss McCreadie,
when this 'M.' had unmistakably sent
messages through Miss McC.'s usual control.&mdash;O.

<p class="center">(<i><b>Added later</b></i>.)
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>Some friends will be interested in this lady,&mdash;a really beautiful
character, with initials M. N. W.,&mdash;so I record something that came
through from Feda on a much later occasion&mdash;in July 1916:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Raymond's got rather a young lady with him. Not the sister
who passed away a little baby. But she's young&mdash;she looks
twenty-four or twenty-five. She's rather slender, rather pretty.
Brown hair, oval face. Not awful handsome, but got a nice expression.
She's very nice, and comes from a high sphere. She's
able to come close to-night, but can't always come. Name
begins with an M. And she says, "Don't think that because she
didn't come, she didn't want to come. She had to keep away for
so long. It was necessary for her to stay away from the earth for
a while, because she had work in high spheres for three years, and
it's difficult for her to come through.</p>

<p>Good, good&mdash;something about the lady, lady&mdash;two people, she
says. Lady and good man. Feda ought to remember it&mdash;a lady
and good man.</p>

<p>Between them Soliver and her, Soliver and Miss Olive, and her.
Lady and good man and M. She must have been very good on
the earth plane, she wasn't ordinary at all. Quite unusual and
very very good. You can tell that by what she looks like now.</p>

<p>She brings a lot of flowers&mdash;pansies, not quite pansies, flower
like a pansy, and not quite a pansy. Heartsease, that's what it is.
She brings lots of those to you. She brought a lot of them when
Raymond wented over there. But not for very long, she didn't&mdash;they
wasn't wanted very long.

<p class="center"><i><b>M. F. A. L. Record of February 4&mdash;continued</b></i></p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He said about some one, that she'd gone right on
to a very high sphere indeed, as near celestial as
could possibly be. His sister, he says&mdash;can't get her
name. [He means Lily, presumably.] He says William
had gone on too, a good way, but not too far to
come to him. [His brother.]</p>

<p>Those who are fond of you never go too far to
come back to you&mdash;sometimes too far to communicate,
never too far to meet you when you pass
over.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">M. F. A. L.</span>&mdash;That's so comforting, darling. I don't want to
hold you back.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>You gravitate here to the ones you're fond of.
Those you're not fond of, if you meet them in the

street, you don't bother yourself to say 'how-do-you-do.'</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">M. F. A. L.</span>&mdash;There are streets, then?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes. He was pleased to see streets and
houses.</p>

<p>At one time, I thought it might be created by
one's own thoughts. You gravitate to a place you
are fitted for. Mother, there's no judge and jury,
you just gravitate, like to like.</p>

<p>I've seen some boys pass on who had nasty
ideas and vices. They go to a place I'm very glad
I didn't have to go to, but it's not hell exactly.
More like a reformatory&mdash;it's a place where you're
given a chance, and when you want to look for something
better, you're given a chance to have it. They
gravitate together, but get so bored. Learn to help
yourself, and immediately you'll be helped. Very
like your world; only no unfairness, no injustice&mdash;a
common law operating for each and every
one.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">M. F. A. L.</span>&mdash;Are all of the same rank and grade?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Rank doesn't count as a virtue. High rank comes
by being virtuous. Those who have been virtuous
have to pass through lower rank to understand
things. All go on to the astral first, just for a
little.</p>

<p>He doesn't remember being on the astral himself.
He thinks where he is now, he's about third.
Summerland&mdash;Homeland, some call it. It is a
very happy medium. The very highest can come
to visit you. It is just sufficiently near the earth
plane to be able to get to those on earth. He
thinks you have the best of it there, so far as he
can see.</p>

<p>Mother, I went to a gorgeous place the other
day.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">M. F. A. L.</span>&mdash;Where was it?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Goodness knows!</p>

<p>I was permitted, so that I might see what was going
on in the Highest Sphere. Generally the High
Spirits come to us.</p>

<p>I wonder if I can tell you what it looked like!</p>

<p>[Until the case for survival is considered established,
it is thought improper and unwise to
relate an experience of a kind which may be
imagined, in a book dealing for the most part
with evidential matter. So I have omitted the
description here, and the brief reported utterance
which followed. I think it fair, however,
to quote the record so far as it refers to the
youth's own feelings, because otherwise the
picture would be incomplete and one-sided,
and he might appear occupied only with comparatively
frivolous concerns.]</p>

<p>Mother, I thrilled from head to foot. He didn't
come near me, and I didn't feel I wanted to go near
him. Didn't feel I ought. The Voice was like a
bell. I can't tell you what he was dressed or robed
in. All seemed a mixture of shining colours.</p>

<p>No good; can you imagine what I felt like when
he put those beautiful rays on to me? I don't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[ 232]</a></span>
know what I've ever done that I should have been
given that wonderful experience. I never thought of
such a thing being possible, not at any rate for years,
and years, and years. No one could tell what I
felt, I can't explain it.</p>

<p>Will they understand it?</p>

<p>I know father and you will, but I want the others
to try. I can't put it into words.</p>

<p>I didn't walk, I had to be taken back to Summerland,
I don't know what happened to me. If you
could faint with delight! Weren't those beautiful
words?</p>

<p>I've asked if Christ will go and be seen by
everybody; but was told, "Not quite in the same
sense as you saw Him." I was told Christ was
always in spirit on earth&mdash;a sort of projection, something
like those rays, something of him in every
one.</p>

<p>People think he is <i>a</i> Spirit, walking about in a
particular place. Christ is everywhere, not as a personality.
There <i>is</i> a Christ, and He lives on the
higher plane, and that is the one I was permitted
to see.</p>

<p>There was more given me in that beautiful message;
I can't remember it all. He said the whole of
it, nearly and word for word, of what I've given
you. You see from that I'm given a mission to do,
helping near the earth plane....</p>

<p>Shall I tell you why I'm so glad that is my work,
given me by the Highest Authority of all!</p>

<p>First of all, I'm proud to do His work, no matter
what it is; but the great thing is, I can be near you
and father.</p>

I used to do.</p>

<p>I treasured it up to give you to-night. I put
it off because I didn't know if I could give it in the
right words that would make them feel like I feel&mdash;or
something like. Isn't it a comfort? You
and father think it well over. I didn't ask for
work to be near the earth plane! I thought that
things would be made right. But think of it
being given me, the work I should have prayed
for!</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">M. F. A. L.</span>&mdash;Then you're nearer?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Much nearer! I was bound to be drawn (?).
So beautiful to think, now I can <i>honestly</i> stay near
the earth plane. Eventually, instead of going up
by degrees, I shall take, as Feda has been promised,
a jump. And when you and father come, you will
be on one side, and father on the other. We shall
be a while in Summerland, just to get used to conditions.
He says very likely we shall be wanted to
keep an eye on the others. He means brothers and
sisters. I can't tell you how pleased I feel&mdash;'pleased'
is a poor word!</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">M. F. A. L.</span>&mdash;About what, my dear?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>About being very near the earth plane.</p>

<p>I've pressed on, getting used to conditions here,
and yet when I went into the Presence I was overawed.</p>

<p>How can people....</p>

<p>It made me wish, in the few seconds I was able
to think of anything, that I had led one of the purest
lives imaginable. If there's any little tiny thing
I've ever done, it would stand out like a mountain.
I didn't have much time to think, but I did feel in
that few seconds....</p>

<p>I felt when I found myself back in Summerland
that I was <i>charged</i> with something&mdash;some wonderful
power. As if I could stop rivers, move mountains;
and so wonderfully glad.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He says, don't bother yourself about trying to
like people you've got an antipathy for, it's waste
of you. Keep love for those who want it, don't
throw it away on those who don't; it's like giving
things to over-fed people when hungry chaps are
standing by.</p>

<p>Do you know that I can feel my ideas altering,
somehow.</p>

<p>I feel more naturally in tune with conditions
very far removed from the earth plane; yet I like
to go round with Paul, and have fun, and enjoy
myself.</p>

<p>After that wonderful experience, I asked some
one if it wasn't stupid to like to have fun and go
with the others. But they said that if you've got
a work to do on the earth plane, you're not to
have all the black side, you are allowed to have the
lighter side too, sunshine and shadow. One throws
the other up, and makes you better able to judge
the value of each. There are places on my
sphere where they can listen to beautiful music
when they choose. Everybody, even here, doesn't
care for music, so it's not in my sphere compulsory.</p>

<p>He likes music and singing, but wouldn't like
to live in the middle of it always, he can go and
hear it if he wants to, he is getting more fond of it
than he was.</p>

<p>Mr. Myers was very pleased. He says, you
know it isn't always the parsons, not always the
parsons, that go highest first. It isn't what you
professed, it's what you've done. If you have not
believed definitely in life after death, but have
tried to do as much as you could, and
led a decent life, and have left alone things you
don't understand, that's all that's required of
you. Considering how simple it is, you'd
think everybody would have done it, but very
few do.</p>

<p>On our side, we expect a few years will make a
great difference in the conditions of people on the
earth plane.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[ 235]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>In five years, ever so many more will be wanting
to know about the life to come, and how they shall
live on the earth plane so that they shall have a
pretty good life when they pass on. They'll do it,
if only as a wise precaution. But the more they
know, the higher lines people will be going on.</p>

<p>Some people ask me, are you pleased with where

I've no curiosity about my body now. It's like

<h2><span class="gesperrt">CHAPTER XXI</span><br />
<span class="small">TWO RATHER EVIDENTIAL SITTINGS BY
O. J. L. ON 3 MARCH 1916</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the morning of 3 March I had a sitting in Mrs.
Kennedy's house with a Mrs. Clegg, a fairly elderly
dame whose peculiarity is that she allows direct
control by the communicator more readily than most
mediums do.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kennedy has had Mrs. Clegg two or three times to
her house, and Paul has learnt how to control her pretty
easily, and is able to make very affectionate demonstrations
and to talk through the organs of the medium, though
in rather a jerky and broken way. She accordingly kindly
arranged an anonymous sitting for me.</p>

<p>The sitting began with sudden clairvoyance, which was
unexpected. It was a genuine though not a specially successful
sitting, and it is worth partially reporting because
of the reference to it which came afterwards through
another medium, on the evening of the same day; making
a simple but exceptionally clear and natural cross-correspondence:&mdash;</p>

<h3><i>Anonymous Sitting of O. J. L. with Mrs. Clegg</i></h3>

<p>At 11.15 a.m. on Friday, 3 March 1916, I arrived at
Mrs. Kennedy's, went up and talked to her in the drawing-room
till nearly 11.30, when Mrs. Clegg arrived.</p>

<p>She came into the room while I was seeing to the fire,
spoke to Mrs. Kennedy, and said, "Oh, is this the gentleman
that I am to sit with?" She was then given a seat
in front of the fire, being asked to get quiet after her
omnibus journey. But she had hardly seated herself before
she said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[ 238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, this room is so full of people; oh, some one so
eager to come! I hear some one say 'Sir Oliver Lodge.'
Do you know anyone of that name?"</p>

<p>I said, yes, I know him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kennedy got up to darken the room slightly, and
Mrs. Clegg ejaculated:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who is Raymond, Raymond, Raymond? He is standing
close to me."</p>

<p>She was evidently going off into a trance, so we moved
her chair back farther from the fire, and without more
preparation she went off.</p>

<p>For some time, however, nothing further happened,
except contortions, struggling to get speech, rubbings of
the back as if in some pain or discomfort there, and a
certain amount of gasping for breath.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kennedy came to try and help, and to give power.
She knelt by her side and soothed her. I sat and waited.</p>

<p>Presently the utterance was distinguished as, "Help me,
where's the doctor?"</p>

<p>After a time, with K. K.'s help, the control seemed
to get a little clearer, and the words, "So glad; father;
love to mother; so glad," frequently repeated in an indistinct
and muffled tone of voice, were heard, followed
by, "Love to all of them."</p>

<p>Nothing was put down at the time, for there seemed
nothing to record&mdash;it seemed only preliminary effort; and
in so far as anything was said, it consisted merely of simple
messages of affection, and indications of joy at being able
to come through, and of disappointment at not being able
to do better. The medium, however, went through a good
deal of pantomime, embracing me, stroking my arm,
patting my knees, and sometimes stroking my head,
sometimes also throwing her arms round me and giving
the impression of being overjoyed, but unable to speak
plainly.</p>

<p>Then other dumb show was begun. He seemed to be
thinking of the things in his kit, or things which had been
in his possession, and trying to enumerate them. He indicated
that his revolver had not come back, and that in
his diary the last page was not written up. I promised to
complete it.</p>

<p>After a time, utterance being so difficult, I gave the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[ 239]</a></span>
medium a pad and pencil, and asked for writing. The
writing was large and sprawly, single words: 'Captain'
among them.</p>

<p>While Raymond was speaking, and at intervals, the
medium kept flopping over to one side or the other, hanging
on the arm of her chair with head down, or else
drooping forward, or with head thrown back&mdash;assuming
various limp and wounded attitudes. Though every now
and then she seemed to make an effort to hold herself up,
and once or twice crossed knees and sat up firm, with arms
more or less folded. But the greater part of the time she
was flopping about.</p>

<p>Presently Raymond said 'Good-bye,' and a Captain
was supposed to control. She now spoke in a vigorous
martial voice, as if ordering things, but saying nothing of
any moment.</p>

<p>Then he too went away, and 'Hope' appeared, who,
I am told, is Mrs. Clegg's normal control. Hope was able
to talk reasonably well, and what she said I recorded for
what it might be worth, but I omit the record, because
though it contained references to people and things outside
the knowledge of the medium or Mrs. Kennedy, and was
therefore evidential as regards the genuineness and honesty
of the medium, it was not otherwise worth reporting, unless
much else of what was said on the same subjects by other
mediums were reported too.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>On the evening of this same 3rd of March&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> later in
the same day that I had sat with Mrs. Clegg&mdash;I went alone
to Mrs. Leonard's house and had rather a remarkable
sitting, at which full knowledge of the Clegg performance
was shown. It is worthy therefore of some careful attention.</p>

<p>After reading this part, the above very abbreviated
record of the Clegg sitting, held some hours before in
another house and other conditions, should again be read.
I wish to call attention to the following 3rd of March
sitting as one of the best; other members of the family
have probably had equally good ones, but my notes are
fuller. I hope it is fully understood that the mannerisms
are Feda's throughout.

Friday, 3 March 1916, from 9.15 p.m. to 11.15 p.m.</i></h3>

</p>

<p>No preliminaries to report. Feda came through
quickly, jerked in the chair, and seemed very pleased
to find me.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>(I asked if she had seen Raymond lately.)</p>

<p>Oh yes, Raymond's here.</p>

<p>He came to help Feda with the lady and gentleman&mdash;on
Monday, Feda thinks it was. Not quite
sure when. But there was a lady and gentleman,
and he came to help; and Feda said, "Go away,
Raymond!" He said, "No, I've come to stay."
He wouldn't go away, and he did help them through
with their boy.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">
[The reference here is to a sitting which a colleague
of mine, Professor and Mrs. Sonnenschein,
had had, unknown to me, with Mrs.
Leonard. I learnt afterwards that the arrangements
had been made by them in a
carefully anonymous manner, the correspondence
being conducted <i>via</i> a friend in
Darlington; so that they were only known
to Mrs. Leonard as "a lady and gentleman
from Darlington." They had reported
to me that their son Christopher had
sent good and evidential messages, and that
Raymond had turned up to help. It
was quite appropriate for Raymond to take
an interest in them and bring their son,
since Christopher Sonnenschein had been an
engineering fellow-student with Raymond
at Birmingham. But there was no earthly
reason, so far as Mrs. Leonard's knowledge
was concerned, for him to put in an appearance;
and indeed Feda at first told him to
'Go away,' until he explained that he
had come to help. Hence the mention of
Raymond, under the circumstances, was
evidential.]</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[ 241]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He's only been once to help beside this, and
then he said, Don't tell the lady he was helping.
[See below.]</p>

<p>He's been with Paulie to-day, to Paulie's
mother's. He says he's been at Paulie's house,
but not with Mrs. Kathie, with another lady, a
medie, Feda thinks. She was older than this one;
a new one to him.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> He wanted to speak through
her, but he found it was difficult. Paul manages it
all right, he says, but <i>he</i> finds it difficult. He says
he started to get through, and then he didn't feel
like himself. It's awful strange when one tries to
control anybody. He wanted to very bad; he
almost had them. (<i>Sotto voce.</i>&mdash;What you mean,
Yaymond?) He says he thought he almost had
them. He means he nearly got through. Oh, he
says, he's not given it up; he's going to try again.
What worries him is that he doesn't feel like himself.
You know, father, I might be anybody. He
says, Do you believe that in that way, practice
makes perfect?</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Yes, I'm sure it gets easier with practice.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Oh, then he'll practise dozens of times, if he
thinks it will be any good.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L</span>.&mdash;Did he like the old woman?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Oh, yes; she's a very good sort.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Who was there sitting?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[This question itself indicates, what was the
fact, that I had so far given no recognition
to the statement that Raymond had been
trying to control a medium on the morning
of that same day. I wanted to take what
came through, without any assistance.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He's not sure, because he didn't seem to get all
properly into the conditions; it was like being in
a kind of mist, in a fog. He felt he was getting
hold of the lady, but he didn't quite know where
he was. He'd got something ready to say, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[ 242]</a></span>
started to try and say it, and it seemed as if he
didn't know where he was.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[Feda reports sometimes in the third person,
sometimes in the first.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>What does she flop about for, father? <i>I</i> don't
want to do that; it bothered me rather, I didn't
know if I was making her ill or something. Paulie
said she thought it was the correct thing to do!
But I wish she wouldn't. If she would only keep
quiet, and let me come calmly, it would be much
easier. Mrs. Kathie [Feda's name for Mrs. Katherine
Kennedy] tries to help all she can, but it
makes such a muddled condition. I might not be
able to get a test through, even when I controlled
better; I should have to get quite at home there,
before I could give tests through her. He and
Paulie used to joke about the old lady, but they
don't now. Paul manages to control; he used to
see Paulie doing it. I will try again, he says, and
I will try again. It's worth trying a few times,
then I can get my bearings, and I feel that what
I wanted to say beforehand I will be able to get
through.</p>

<p>Feda has an idea that what he had saved up to
say was only just the usual messages. He had got
them ready in his head; he had learnt it up&mdash;just a
few words. Paulie told him he had better do that,
and then (oh, you had better not tell Mrs. Kathie
this, for it isn't polite!)&mdash;and then Paulie told him
to spit it out. And that's what he tried to do&mdash;just
to say the few words that he had learnt up. He
just wanted to say how pleased he was to see you.
He wanted also to speak about his mother, and
to bring in, if he could, about having talked to you
through Feda. Just simple things like that. He
had to think of simple things, because Paulie had
told him that it was no good trying to think of
anything in-tri-cate.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[Feda always pronounces what she no doubt
considers long words in a careful and drawnout
manner.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He didn't see clearly, but he felt. He had a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[ 243]</a></span>
good idea that you were there, and that Mrs.
Kathie was there, but he wasn't sure; he was all
muddled up. Poor Mrs. Kathie was doing her best.
He says, Don't change the conditions, if you try it
again. He never quite knows whether he is going
to have good conditions or not. He wanted to
speak about all this. That's all about that.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[This is a completely accurate reference to what
had happened with Mrs. Clegg in the morning
of the same day. Everything is properly
and accurately represented. It is the best
thing about the sitting perhaps, though there
are many good things in it.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[The next incident concerns other people&mdash;and
I usually omit these&mdash;but I propose to include
this one.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>About the lady he tried to help&mdash;the one that he
didn't want Feda to tell who he was (p. <a href="#Page_241">241</a>).</p>

<p>He was helping through a man who had got
drowned. This lady had had no belief nor nothing
in spiritual things before. The guides brought her
to Feda, that she might speak with a dear friend of
hers. I helped him, he says, and got both of his
initials through to her&mdash;E. A.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Do I know these people?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, you write a lot to the lady.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[I remembered afterwards that I had had some
correspondence with a lady who was told at
a sitting, apparently by Raymond, that I
knew a Dr. A. She was and is a stranger,
but for this curious introduction.]</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Is A the surname?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, the spirit's, not the lady's. The lady doesn't
know that he [Raymond] is telling you this. And
she doesn't know that he helped her. He says, It's
for your own use, father. It's given her a new outlook
on life.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;I have no idea who she is. Can you get her
name?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Oh yes, she's a lady called Mrs. D. [Full name
given easily, but no doubt got from the sitter
in ordinary course.] And before, you see, she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[ 244]</a></span>
living a worldly life. She was interested in a way,
but not much. She never tried to come into it.
When she came, she thought she would have her
fortune told. Raymond was waiting for her to come,
and brought up the right conditions at once. The
man was a nice man, he liked him, and he wanted
to bring her into it. The man was fond of her. Raymond
has been helping him a lot. He says, I can
only help in a small way, but if you could go round
and see the people just on the verge of learning
something! I can't help them in a big way, but
still, it's something important even what I can do.
For every one I bring in like that lady, there will be
a dozen coming from that.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span> (still remembering nothing about these people.)&mdash;Did
the man drown himself?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Oh no, he wented down in a boat; they nearly
all wented down together.</p>

<p>The lady wasn't expecting him&mdash;she nearly
flopped over when he came.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Was he related to the lady?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>No, but he had been the biggest thing in her life.
He says it seemed as though she must have felt
something, to make her write to you.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;However did Raymond know that she had
written to me?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Feda doesn't know. (<i>Sotto voce.</i>&mdash;Tell Feda,
Yaymond.)</p>

<p>Do you believe me, father, I really can't tell you
how I know some things. It's not through inquiry,
but sometimes I get it just like a Marconi apparatus
receives a message from somewhere, and doesn't
know where it comes from at first. Sometimes I
try to find out things, and I can't.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[I perceived gradually that this episode related
to some one named E. A. (unknown to me),
about whom I had been told at a Feda sitting
on Friday, 28 January 1916, Raymond
seeming to want me to speak to E. A.'s
father about him. And in a note to that
sitting it is explained how I received a letter
shortly afterwards from a stranger, a Mrs. D.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[ 245]</a></span>
who consulted me about informing Dr. A.
of the appearance of his son. The whole
episode is an excellent one, but it concerns
other people, and if narrated at all must be
narrated more fully and in another place.
Suffice it to say that the son had been lost in
tragic circumstances, and that the father is
impressed by the singular nature of the evidence
that has now been given through the
lady&mdash;a special visit to Scotland having been
made by her for that express purpose. She
had not known the father before, but she
found him and his house as described;
and he admits the details as surprisingly
accurate.]</span></p>
</div>

<p>Here is the extract from my sitting of 28 January 1916
relating to this affair:&mdash;</p>

<h3>EXTRACT FROM O. J. L.'S SITTING WITH MRS.
LEONARD,<br />FRIDAY, 28 JANUARY 1916</h3>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He has met somebody called E., Raymond has. He
doesn't know who it is, but wonders if you do.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Is she an old lady?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>It's a man, he says. He was drownded. I have helped
him a bit, at least I tried, he says. He passed on before
Raymond did.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Did he drown himself?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Raymond doesn't say that. His name was E. He was
from Scotland. You will know his father.</p>

<p>Raymond says, I have got a motive in this, father;
I don't want to say too much, and I don't want to say too
little. You have met E.'s father, and you will meet him
again; he comes from Scotland. Raymond is not quite
certain, but he thinks he is in Scotland now. His father's
name begins with an A, so the other man is E. A. He
was fighting his ship. Raymond thinks they was all
drownded. He's older than Raymond. Raymond says
he's a pretty dark chap. You know his father best, I
don't know whether you knew the other chap at all. You
have known his father for some years, but you don't often
get a chance of meeting. I have got an idea that you will
be hearing from him soon. Then you will be able to unload
this onto him. They are trying to bring it about,
that meeting with the father of E.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[ 246]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;I could make a guess at the surname, but perhaps I had
better not.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>No, don't. You know I'm not always sure of my facts.
I know pretty well how things are, and I think I am pretty
safe in saying that it is Scotland. He gives D. also.
That's not a person, it's a place. Some place not far from
it, called D., he says. It's near, not the place, where he
lives. 'Flanked,' he calls it, 'flanked' on the other side by L.
They never knew how E. passed on really. They know he
was drowned, but not how it happened.</p>
</div>

<p>On receiving this message I felt that the case was a genuine
one, and that I did know a Dr. A. precisely as described. And I
also gradually remembered that he had lost a son at sea, though I
did not know the son. But I felt that I must wait for further
particulars before broaching what might be an unpalatable
subject to Dr. A.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>End of extract from 28 January 1916.</i>)
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>Ultimately I did receive further particulars as narrated
above, and so a month later I did go to call on the old
Doctor, after the ice had been broken by Mrs. D.,&mdash;who in
some trepidation had made a special journey for the purpose,
and then nearly came away without opening the
subject,&mdash;and I verified the trance description of his house
which Mrs. D. had received and sent me. Indeed, all the
facts stated turned out to be true.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>The sitting of 3 March, now being reported, and interrupted
by this quotation from a previous sitting, went
on thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He took his mother some red roses, and he wants
you to tell her. He took them to her from the spirit
world, they won't materialise, but I gathered some
and took them to her. This isn't a test, father.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;No. Very well, you just want her to know. I
will tell her.</p>

<p class="center">(A little talk omitted.)</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -3.5em;"><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Do you want to say
anything about the other two people that you helped&mdash;last Monday, I think it
was? [The Sonnenscheins; still only known to Mrs. Leonard as a lady and gentleman from Darlington.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>No, there's nothing much to tell you about
that, or about them. But he brought a son to them.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[ 247]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He stood on one side so as not to take any of the
power. He just came at first to show Feda it was
all right, and he just came in at the end to send his
love.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Why did he help those particular people?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[I knew why, but I thought proper to ask, since
from the medium's point of view there was no reason at all.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He says he had to. They have been worrying
about whether their son had suffered much pain
before he passed on. There seems to have been
some uncertainty about as to whether he had or not.
His body wasn't recovered as soon as it ought to
have been. But he didn't suffer much. He was
numbed, and didn't as a matter of fact feel much.
He throwed up his arms, and rolled down a bank
place.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[Christopher Sonnenschein was killed by falling
down a snow mountain, and his body was not
recovered for five days.]</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Did you know these people before?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes. He says, yes. But he won't tell Feda who
they is.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Does he want to send them any message?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He says nothing further has come out, except
that he is getting on very well, and that he was
pleased. You might tell them that he is happier
now. Yes, he is, since he seed them.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[The sitting referred to here, as having been
held by a lady and gentleman last Monday,
refers to my colleague and his wife and their
deceased son Christopher. Their identity
had been completely masked by the arrangements
they had made, without my
knowledge. The letters making arrangements
were sent round by Darlington to be
posted, in order to cover up tracks and remove
all chance of a discoverable connexion
with me. (See p. <a href="#Page_240">240</a>.) Hence it is interesting
that Raymond turned up to help, for in their
normal life the two youths had known each
other.]</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[ 248]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He has been trying to help you since he saw
you here last time. He thought that you knew
that he was. He did try hard. He says, I helped
you in such a funny way. I got near you and felt
such a desire to help you and prevent you from
getting tired. He was concentrating on the back
of your head, and sort of saying to himself, and
impressing the thought towards you: "It's coming
easy, you shan't get tired, the brain is going to
be very receptive, everything is going to flow
through it easily in order." I feel myself saying it
all the time, and I get so close I nearly lean on
you. To my great delight, I saw you sit up once,
and you said: "Ah, that's good." It was some little
time back.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;I speak to your photograph sometimes.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes. I can speak to you without a photograph!
I am often with you, very often.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He's taking Feda into a room with a desk in it;
too big for a desk, it must be a table. A sort of a
desk, a pretty big one. A chair is in front of it,
not a chair like that, a high up chair, more wooden,
not woolly stuff; and the light is falling on to the
desk; and you are sitting there with a pen or
pencil in your hand; you aren't writing much, but
you are looking through writing, and making bits of
writing on it; you are not doing all the writing yourself,
but only bits on it. Raymond is standing at
the back of you; he isn't looking at what you are
doing. [The description is correct.]</p>

<p>He thought you were tired out last time you
came here. He knows you are sometimes. He's
been wanting to say to you, "Leave some of it."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;But there's so much to be done.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, he knows it isn't easy to leave it. But it
would be better in the end if you can leave a bit,
father. You are doing too much.</p>

<p>You know that I am longing and dying for the
day when you come over to me. It will be a
splendid day for me. But I mustn't be selfish.
I have got to work to keep you away from us, and
that's not easy for me.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[ 249]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He says that lots over here talk, and say that
you will be doing the most wonderful work of your
life through the war. People are ready to listen
now. They had too many things before to let
them think about them; but now it's the great thing
to think about the after-life.</p>

<p>I want you to know that when first I came over
here, I thought it a bit unfair that such a lot of
fellows were coming over in the prime of life, coming
over here. But now he sees that for every one
that came over, dozens of people open their eyes,
and want to know where he has gone to. Directly
they want to know, they begin to learn something.
Some of them never stopped to think seriously before.
"He must be somewhere," they say, "he was
so full of life; can we find out?" Then I see that
through this, people are going to find out, and find
out not only for themselves, but will pass it on to
many others, and so it will grow.</p>

<p>He wants to tell you that Mr. Myers says that
in ten years from now the world will be a different
place. He says that about fifty per cent. of the
civilised portion of the globe will be either spiritualists,
or coming into it.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Fifteen per cent.?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Fifty, he said.</p>

<p>Raymond says, I am no judge of that, but he
isn't the only one that thinks it. He says, I've
got a kind of theory, in a crude sort of way, that
man has made the earth plane into such a hotbed
of materialism and selfishness, that man again has
to atone by sacrifices of mankind in the prime of
their physical life. So that by that prime self-effacement,
they will bring more spiritual conditions
on to the earth, which will crush the spirit of
materialism. He says that isn't how I meant to
put it, but I've forgotten how I meant to say it.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -3.5em;"><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Well now, Raymond, Mr. Myers sent me a message
to say that you had got some tests ready to
get through, and that I was to give you an opportunity of giving them.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Oh yes, he says. But I can't get anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[ 250]</a></span>
through about the Argonauts: that seems worst of
anything.</p>

<p>He's showing Feda a thing that looks like a canvas
house. Yes, it must be a canvas house. And
it looks to Feda as though it's on a place that
seems to be open&mdash;a wide place. Yes, no, there's
not much green showing where Feda can see.
There's a kind of a door in it, like that. (Feda
made some sign I didn't catch.) The canvas is
sort of grey, quite a light colour, but not quite
white. Oh yes, Feda feels the sound of water not
far from it&mdash;ripple, ripple. Feda sees a boy&mdash;not
Raymond&mdash;half lying, half sitting at the door of
the tent place, and he hasn't got a proper coat on;
he's got a shirt thing on here, and he's like spreaded
out. It's a browny-coloured earth, not nice green,
but sandy-coloured ground. As Feda looks at the
land, the ground rises sharp at the back. Must
have been made to rise, it sticks up in the air.
He's showing it as though it should be in some
photograph or picture. Feda got wondering about
it, what it was for. It's a funny-shaped tent, not
round, sort of lop-sided. The door isn't a
proper door, it flops. You ought to be able to
see a picture of this. [See photographs opposite.]</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Has it got to do with the Argonauts?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>No.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Oh, it's not Coniston then?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>No.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Is it by the sea?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Near the water, he says; he doesn't say the sea.
No, he won't say that; he says, near water. It
looks hot there.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Will the boys know?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>You will know soon about it, he says.</p>

<p>Feda gets a feeling that there are two or three
moving about inside that tent.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Is it all one chamber in the tent?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He didn't say that. He was going to say, no,
and then he stopped to think. No, I don't think
it was, it was divided off.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>[See photographs of two forms of this tent.]</p>

<p>Now he is showing something right on top of
that. Now he is showing Feda a yacht, a boat
with white sails. Now he is going back to the tent
again. The raised up land is at the back of the tent,
well set back. It doesn't give an even sticking up,
but it goes right along, with bits up and bits lower
down.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[The description could not be completely taken
down, but it gave the impression of a raised
bank of varying height, behind an open
space, and a tent in front of it. It quite
suggested that sort of picture.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[See photograph facing p. <a href="#Page_252">252</a>.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Maps, what's that? Maps, maps, he says. He's
saying something about maps. This is something
that the boys will know. Poring, he says. Not
pouring anything out, but poring over maps. Ask
the boys. [See note after further reference to
maps later in the sitting.]</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;What about that yacht with sails; did it run on
the water?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>No. (Feda, <i>sotto voce</i>.&mdash;Oh, Raymond, don't be
silly!) He says, no. (Feda.&mdash;It must have done!)
He's showing Feda like a thing on land, yes, a
land thing. It's standing up, like edgeways. A
narrow thing. No it isn't water, but it has got
nice white sails.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Did it go along?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He says it <span class="smcap">DIDN'T</span>! He's laughing! When he
said 'didn't' he shouted it. Feda should have said,
'He laid peculiar emphasis on it.' This is for the
boys.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Had they got to do with that thing?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, they will know, they will understand.
Yes, he keeps on showing like a boat&mdash;a yacht, he
calls it, a yacht.</p>

<p>[See note below and photographs.]</p>

<p>Now he is showing Feda some figures. Something
flat, like a wall. Rods and things, long rods.
Some have got little round things shaking on them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[ 252]</a></span>
like that. And he's got strings, some have got
strings. 'Strings' isn't the right word, but it will
do. Smooth, strong, string-like. In the corner,
where it's a little bit dark, some one is standing
up and leaning against something, and a piece of
stuff is flapping round them.</p>

<p>Now he is saying again something about maps.
He's going to the maps again. It isn't a little map,
but it's one you can unfold and fold up small. And
they used to go with their fingers along it, like that&mdash;not
he only, but the boys. And it wasn't at home,
but when they were going somewhere&mdash;some distance
from home. And Feda gets the impression as
though they must be looking at the map when it was
moving. They seem to be moving smoothly along,
like in one of those horrible trains. Feda has never
been in a train.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[The mention of folded-up maps cannot be
considered important, but it is appropriate,
because many of the boys' common reminiscences
group round long motor drives in
Devonshire and Cornwall, when they must
frequently have been consulting the kind of
map described.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[<i>Note by O. J. L. on Tent and Boat.</i>&mdash;All this
about the tent and boat is excellent, though
not outside my knowledge. The description
of the scenery showed plainly that it
was Woolacombe sands that was meant&mdash;whither
the family had gone in the summer
for several years&mdash;a wide open stretch of
sand, with ground rising at the back, as described,
and with tents along under the bank,
one of which&mdash;a big one&mdash;had been made
by the boys. It was on wheels, it had
two chambers with a double door, and was
used for bathing by both the boys and girls.
Quite a large affair, oblong in shape, like a
small cottage. One night a gale carried it
up to the top of the sand-hills and wrecked it.
We saw it from the windows in the morning.</span></p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>The boys pulled it to pieces, and made a
smaller tent of the remains, this time with
only one chamber, and its shape was now a
bit lop-sided. I felt in listening to the description
that there was some hesitation in
Raymond's mind as to whether he was
speaking of the first or the second stage of
this tent.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">As for the sand-boat, it was a thing they likewise
made at Mariemont, and carted down
to Woolacombe. A kind of long narrow
platform or plank on wheels, with a rudder
and sails. At first, when it had small sails,
it only went with a light passenger and a
strong wind behind. But in a second season
they were more ambitious, and made bigger
sails to it, and that season I believe it went
along the sands very fast occasionally; but
it still wouldn't sail at right angles to the
wind as they wanted. They finally smashed
the mast by sailing in a gale with three passengers.
There had been ingenuity in making
it, and Raymond had been particularly active
over it, as he was over all constructions. On
the whole it was regarded as a failure, the
wheels were too small; and Raymond's
'<span class="smcap">DIDN'T</span>' is quite accepted.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">References to these things were evidently some
of the tests (p. <a href="#Page_249">249</a>) which he had got together
for transmission to me. [See photographs.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">The rod and rings and strings, mentioned after
the 'boat,' I don't at present understand. So
far as I have ascertained, the boys don't
understand, either, at present.]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>I don't know whether I have got anything more
that I can really call a test. You will have to take,
he says (he's laughing now)&mdash;take the information
about the old lady as a test.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;You mean what he began with? [<i>i.e.</i> about Mrs.
Clegg.]</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[ 254]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Well, it's a very good one.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He's been trying to find somebody whose name
begins with K. But it isn't Mrs. Kathie, it's a
gentleman. He's been trying to find him.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;What for?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He thought his mother would be interested.
There's something funny about this. One is in the
spirit world, but one they believe is still on the
earth plane. He hasn't come over yet. [One of
the two referred to is certainly dead; the other
may possibly, but very improbably, be a prisoner.]
There's a good deal of mystery about this, but
I'm sure he isn't actually come over yet. Some
people think that because we are here, we have
only to go anywhere we choose, and find out anything
we like. But that's Tommy-rot. They are
limited, but they send messages to each other, and
what he sincerely believes is, that that man has
not passed on.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Mother thinks he has, and so do his people.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, yes. I don't know whether it would be
advisable to tell them anything, but I have a
feeling that he isn't here. I have been looking for
him everywhere.</p>

<p>He keeps on building up a J. He doesn't answer
when Feda asks what that is. He says there will
be a few surprises for people later on.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Well, I take it that he wants me to understand
that J. K. is on our side?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, he keeps nodding his head. Yes, in the
body. Mind, he says, I've got a feeling&mdash;I can
only call it a feeling&mdash;that he has been hurt,
practically unconscious. Anyway, time will prove
if I am right.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;I hope he will continue to live, and come back.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>I hope so too. Except for the possible doubt
about it, I would say tell them at once. But after
all they are happier in thinking that he has gone
over, than that he's in some place undergoing terrible
privations.</p>

<p>Now he's saying something carefully to Feda.
He says they should not go by finding a stick. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[ 255]</a></span>
wants you to put that down&mdash;they ought not to
go by finding a stick.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Oh, they found a stick, did they?</p>

<p>Yes, that's how, yes.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[I clearly understood that this statement referred
to a certain Colonel, about whom
there was uncertainty for months. But a
funeral service has now been held&mdash;an impressive
one, which M. F. A. L. attended.
On inquiry from her, I find (what I didn't
know at the time of the sitting) that the
evidence of his death is a riding-whip, which
they found in the hands of an unrecognisable
corpse. From some initials on this riding-whip,
they thought it belonged to him; and
on this evidence have concluded him dead.
So far as I know, they entertain no doubt
about it. At any rate, we have heard none
expressed, either publicly or privately. Hence,
the information now given may possibly
turn out of interest, though there is always
the possibility that, if he is a prisoner in
Germany, he may not survive the treatment.
He was leading an attack on the Hohenzollern
Redoubt when he fell; he was seen
to fall, wounded; there was great slaughter,
and when at night his man returned to try
and find him, he could not be found.
This is my recollection of the details, but
of course they can be more accurately given.
At what period the whip was found, I
don't know, but can ascertain.] (See also

Jackson, and then he pulled himself up, and changed

<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[<i>Contemporary Note by O. J. L.</i>&mdash;The episode of
Mr. Jackson and the bird is a good one. 'Mr.
Jackson' is the comic name of our peacock.
Within the last week he has died, partly, I
fear, by the severe weather. But his legs
have been rheumatic and troublesome for
some time; and in trying to walk he of late
has tumbled down on them. He was found
dead in a yard on a cold morning with his
neck broken. One of the last people I saw
before leaving home for this sitting was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[ 258]</a></span>
man whom Lady Lodge had sent to take the
bird's body and have it stuffed. She showed
him a wooden pedestal on which she thought
it might be placed, and tail feathers were
being sent with it. Hence, the reference to
the pedestal, if not telepathic from me, shows
a curious knowledge of what was going on.
And the jocular withholding from Feda of the
real meaning of Mr. Jackson, and the appropriate
remarks made concerning him which
puzzled Feda, were quite in Raymond's vein
of humour.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">Perhaps it was unfortunate that I had mentioned
a bird first, but I tried afterwards, by my
manner and remarks, completely to dissociate
the name Jackson from what I had asked before
about the bird; and Raymond played
up to it.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">It may be that he acquires some of these contemporary
items of family information
through sittings which are held in Mariemont,
where of course all family gossip is
told him freely, no outsider or medium being
present. But the death of Mr. Jackson, and
the idea of having him stuffed and put on a
pedestal, were very recent, and I was surprised
that he had knowledge of them. I
emphasise the episode as exceptionally
good.]</span></p>

<p>He's trying to show Feda the side of a house;
not a wall, it has got glass. He's taking Feda round
to it; it has got glass stuff. Yes, and when you
look in, it's like flowers inside and green stuff. He
used to go there a lot&mdash;be there, he says. Red-coloured
pots.</p>

through. I think I have got some. When I go
away, I pat myself on the back and think, That's
something for them to say, "Old Raymond does

people think it's because he has forgotten. It isn't
a case of forgetting. He doesn't forget anything.</p>

at that time?</p>

he says, father, He doesn't come and mingle freely,
here and there and everywhere. I mean, not in that
sense; but we are always conscious, and we feel
him. We are conscious of his presence. But you
know that people think that when they go over, they
will be with him hand in hand, but of course they're
wrong.</p>

about that now, not until he's able to say it through

wrong, that it won't be right; it may get twisted.

</p>

<p>(Mrs. Leonard arrived about 5.30 to tea, for a sitting
with M. F. A. L. I happened to be able to come too, in
order to take notes. She had just come away from another
sitting, and had had some difficulty in getting rid
of her previous sitter in time, which rather bothered her.
The result was not specially conducive to lucidity, and the
sitting seemed only a moderately good one.</p>

<p>When Feda arrived she seemed pleased, and said:&mdash;)</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes it is, yes, it's Soliver!</p>

<p>How are you? Raymond's here!</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">M. F. A. L.</span>&mdash;Is he here already?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, of course he is!</p>

<p>(Feda, <i>sotto voce</i>.&mdash;What's he say?) He says he
hasn't come to play with Feda, or make jokes; he's
come about serious things.</p>

<p>Do you remember, Miss Olive [Feda's name for
Lady Lodge], some time ago, about that beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[ 263]</a></span>
experience what he had? He's so glad that you
and Soliver know about it, even though the others
can't take it in. Years hence he thinks they may.
He says, over there, they don't mind talking about
the real things, over there, 'cos they're the things
that count.</p>

<p>He thinks the one that took it in mostly was
Lionel. Yes, it seemed to sink in mostly; he was
turning it over afterwards, though he didn't say
much. He's more ready for that than the others.
He says he would never have believed it when he
was here, but he is.</p>

<p>He hasn't been to that place again, not that
same place. But he's been to a place just below it.
He's been attending lectures, at what they call, "halls
of learning": you can prepare yourself for the higher
spheres while you are living in lower ones. He's on
the third, but he's told that even now he could go
on to the fourth if he chose; but he says he would
rather be learning the laws ap-per-taining to each
sphere while he's still living on the third, because
it brings him closer&mdash;at least until you two have come
over. He will stay and learn, where he is. He
wouldn't like to go on there and then find it to
be difficult to get back. He will wait till we can
go happily and comfortably together!</p>

<p>Would it interest you for him to tell you about
one of the places he's been to? It's so interesting
to him, that he might seem to exaggerate; but the
experience is so wonderful, it lives with him.</p>

<p>He went into a place on the fifth sphere&mdash;a place
he takes to be made of alabaster. He's not sure
that it really was, but it looked like that. It looked
like a kind of a temple&mdash;a large one. There were
crowds passing into this place, and they looked
very happy. And he thought, "I wonder what I'm
going to see here." When he got mixed up with
the crowd going into the temple, he felt a kind of&mdash;(he's
stopping to think). It's not irreverency what
he says, but he felt a kind of feeling as if he had had
too much champagne&mdash;it went to his head, he felt
too buoyant, as if carried a bit off the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[ 264]</a></span></p>

<p>That's 'cos he isn't quite attuned to the conditions
of that sphere. It's a most extraordinary feeling.
He went in, and he saw that though the building
was white, there were many different lights: looked
like certain places covered in red, and ... was
blue, and the centre was orange. These were not the
crude colours that go by those names, but a softened
shade. And he looked to see what they came
from. Then he saw that a lot of the windows were
extremely large, and the panes in them had glass of
these colours. And he saw that some of the people
would go and stand in the pinky coloured light
that came through the red glass, and others
would stand in the blue light, and some would stand
in the orange or yellow coloured light. And
he thought, "What are they doing that for?"
Then some one told him that the pinky coloured
light was the light of the love-colour; and the blue
was the light of actual spiritual healing; and the
orange was the light of intellect. And that, according
to what people wanted, they would go and
stand under that light. And the guide told him
that it was more important than what people on
earth knew. And that, in years to come, there
would be made a study of the effect of different
lights.</p>

<p>The pinky people looked clever and developed
in their attitude and mentality generally; but they
hadn't been able to cultivate the love-interest much,
their other interests had overpowered that one.
And the people who went into the intellectual light
looked softer and happy, but not so clever looking.
He says he felt more drawn to the pink light himself,
but some one said, "No, you have felt a good
deal of that," and he got out and went into the
other two, and he felt that he liked the blue light
best. And he thinks that perhaps you will read
something into that. I had the other conditions,
but I wanted the other so much. The blue seemed
to call me more than the others. After I had been
in it some time, I felt that nothing mattered much,
except preparing for the spiritual life. He says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[ 265]</a></span>
that the old Raymond seemed far away at the time,
as though he was looking back on some one else's
life&mdash;some one I hadn't much connexion with, and
yet who was linked on to me. And he felt, "What
does anything matter, if I can only attain this beautiful
uplifting feeling." I can't tell you what I felt
like, but reading it over afterwards, perhaps you
will understand. Words feel powerless to describe
it. He won't try, he will just tell you what happened
after.</p>

<p>We sat down&mdash;the seats were arranged something
like pews in a church&mdash;and as he looked
towards the aisle, he saw coming up it about seven
figures. And he saw, from his former experience,
that they were evidently teachers come down from
the seventh sphere. He says, they went up to the
end part, and they stood on a little raised platform;
and then one of them came down each of
the little aisles, and put out their hands on those
sitting in the pews. And when one of the Guides
put his hand on his head, he felt a mixture of all
three lights&mdash;as if he understood everything, and
as if everything that he had ever felt, of anger or
worry, all seemed nothing. And he felt as if
he could rise to any height, and as if he could
raise everybody round him. As if he had such a
power in himself. He's stopping to think over
it again.</p>

<p>They sat and listened, and the first part of the
ceremony was given in a lecture, in which one of
the Guides was telling them how to teach others on
the lower spheres and earth plane, to come more
into the spiritual life, while still on those lower
planes. I think that all that went before was to
make it easy to understand. And he didn't get
only the words of the speaker, words didn't seem
to matter, he got the thought&mdash;whole sentences, instead
of one word at a time. And lessons were
given on concentration, and on the projection of
uplifting and helpful thoughts to those on the
earth plane. And as he sat there&mdash;he sat, they
were not kneeling&mdash;he felt as if something was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[ 266]</a></span>
going from him, through the other spheres on to
the earth, and was helping somebody, though he
didn't know who it was. He can't tell you how
wonderful it was; not once it happened, but several
times.</p>

<p>He's even been on to the sixth sphere too. The
sixth sphere was even more beautiful than the fifth,
but at present he didn't want to stay there. He
would rather be helping people where he is.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Does he see the troubles of people on the earth?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, he does sometimes.</p>

<p>I do wish that we could alter people so that
they were not ashamed to talk about the things
that matter. He can see people preparing for the
summer holidays, and yet something may prevent
them. But the journey that they have got to go
some time, that they don't prepare for at all.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">M. F. A. L.</span>&mdash;How can you prepare for it?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, by speaking about it openly, and living your
life so as to make it easier for yourself and
others.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Is Raymond still there? Has he got any more
tests to give, or anything to say, to the boys or
anybody?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Did they understand about the yacht?</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Yes, they did.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>And about the tent?</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Yes, they did.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He's very pleased&mdash;it bucks him up when he gets
things through.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Have you learnt any more about
[the Colonel<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>]?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He's not on the spirit side. He feels sure he
isn't. Somebody told him that there was a body
found, near the place where he had been, and it
was dressed in uniform like he had had. But
something had happened to it here (pointing to her
head).</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Who was it told you?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Some one on the other side; just a messenger,
not one who knew all about it. No, the messenger
didn't seem to know J. K. personally, but he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[ 267]</a></span>
gathered the information from the minds of people
on the earth plane. And Feda isn't quite sure, but
thinks that there was something missing from the
body&mdash;missing from the body that they took to be
him, which would have identified him.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Do you mean the face?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>No, he doesn't mean the face.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">(M. F. A. L., here pointing to her chest, signified
to me that she knew that it was the identification
disk that was missing.)</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">M. F. A. L.</span>&mdash;Why was it missing?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Because it wasn't he! In the first place, it
couldn't be, but if that had only been there, they
would have known. He can't say where he is at
the present moment, but he heard a few days ago
that he is being kept somewhere, and as far as he
can make out, in Belgium. It's as though he had
been taken some distance.</p>

<p>Raymond's not showing this&mdash;but Feda's shown
in a sort of flash a letter. First a B, and then an
R. But the B doesn't mean Belgium; it's either
a B or an R, or both. It just flashed up. It may
mean the place where he is. But Raymond
doesn't know where he is, only he's quite sure that
he isn't on the spirit side. But he's afraid he's
ill.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Have you anything more to say about E. A.?
[See 3 March record, p. <a href="#Page_243">243</a>.]</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>No, no more. Raymond came to Feda to help
the lady who came. Feda started describing Raymond.
And he said, no, only come to help. And
then he brought the one what was drownded. He
came to help also with another, but Feda didn't
tell that lady, 'cos she didn't know you. He
doesn't like Feda to tell. Feda couldn't understand
why he wanted to help, because she didn't
know he knew that gentleman. He helped E. A.
to build up a picture of his home. Perhaps she
thinks it was Feda being so clever!</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Yes, I know, she's been there to see it. [See
p. <a href="#Page_245">245</a>.]</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, and she found it what she said. He told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[ 268]</a></span>
her that she wouldn't be seeing his mother. She
couldn't see why she shouldn't see his mother; but
she didn't. [True.]</p>

<p>Raymond hasn't got any good tests. He can't
manufacture them, and they are so hard to remember.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Is he still in his little house?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Oh yes, he feels at home there.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;He said it was made of bricks&mdash;I could make
nothing of that.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>I knew you couldn't! It's difficult to explain.
At-om-; he say something about at-om-ic principle.
They seem to be able to draw (?) certain unstable
atoms from the atmosphere and crystallise them as
they draw near certain central attraction. That isn't
quite what Feda thinks of it. Feda has seen like
something going round&mdash;a wheel&mdash;something like
electricity, some sparks dropping off the edge of the
wheel, and it goes crick, crick, and becomes like
hard; and then they falls like little raindrops into
the long thing under the wheel&mdash;Raymond calls it
the accumulator. I can't call them anything but
bricks. It's difficult to know what to call them. Wait
until you come over, and I'll show you round. And
you will say, "By Jove, so they are!" Things are
quite real here. Mind, I don't say things are as
heavy as on the earth, because they're not. And
if he hit or kicked something it wouldn't displace it
so much as on the earth, because we're lighter. I
can't tell you exactly what it is; I'm not very interested
in making bricks, but I can see plainly how
it's apparently done.</p>

<p>He says it appears to him too, that the spirit
spheres are built round the earth plane, and seem
to revolve with it. Only, naturally, the first sphere
isn't revolving at such a rate as the third, fourth,
fifth, sixth, and seventh spheres. Greater circumference
makes it seem to revolve more rapidly. That
seems to have an actual effect on the atmospheric
conditions prevailing in any one of the spheres. Do
you see what he's getting at?</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O. J. L.</span>&mdash;Yes. He only means that the peripheral velocity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[ 269]</a></span>
is greater for the bigger spheres, though the angular
velocity is the same.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Yes, that's just what he means. And it does
affect the different conditions, and that's why he
felt a bit careful when he was on a higher sphere,
in hanging on to the ground.</p>
</div>

<p>[A good deal of this struck me as nonsense; as
if Feda had picked it up from some sitter.
But I went on recording what was said.]</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>Such a lot of people think it's a kind of thought-world,
where you think all sort of things&mdash;that it's
all "think." But when you come over you see that
there's no thinking about it; it's <i>there</i>, and it does
impress you with reality. He does wish you would
come over. He will be as proud as a cat with something
tails&mdash;two tails, he said. Proud as a cat with
two tails showing you round the places. He says,
father will have a fine time, poking into everything,
and turning everything inside out.</p>

<p>There's plenty flowers growing here, Miss Olive,
you will be glad to hear. But we don't cut them
here. They doesn't die and grow again; they seem
to renew themselves. Just like people, they are
there all the time renewing their spirit bodies. The
higher the sphere he went to, the lighter the bodies
seemed to be&mdash;he means the fairer, lighter in colour.
He's got an idea that the reason why people
have drawn angels with long fair hair and very fair
complexion is that they have been inspired
by somebody from very high spheres. Feda's
not fair; she's not brown, but olive coloured; her
hair is dark. All people that's any good has black
hair.</p>

<p>Do you know that [a friend] won't be satisfied
unless he comes and has a talk through the table.
Feda doesn't mind now, 'cos she has had a talk.
So she will go now and let him talk through the
table all right.</p>

<p>Give Feda's love to all of them, specially to
SLionel&mdash;Feda likes him.</p>
</div>

<p>(Mrs. Leonard now came-to, and after about ten
minutes she and M. F. A. L. sat at a small
octagonal table, which, in another five minutes,
began to tilt.)</p>

<p>[But the subject now completely changed, and,
if reported at all, must be reported elsewhere.]
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>I may say that several times, during a Feda sitting, some
special communicator has asked for a table sitting to follow,
because he considers it more definite and more private. And
certainly some of the evidence so got has been remarkable;
as indeed it was on this occasion. But the record concerns
other people, distant friends of my wife, some of whom take
no interest in the subject whatever.</p>

<h3>I. SIMULTANEOUS SITTINGS IN LONDON
AND EDGBASTON</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Special 'Honolulu' Test Episode</span></h3>

<p>Lionel and Norah, going through London on the way
to Eastbourne, on Friday, 26 May 1916, arranged to have
a sitting with Mrs. Leonard about noon. They held one
from 11.55 to 1.30, and a portion of their record is transcribed
below.</p>

<p>At noon it seems suddenly to have occurred to Alec
in Birmingham to try for a correspondence test; so he
motored up from his office, extracted some sisters from
the Lady Mayoress's Depot, where they were making surgical
bandages, and took them to Mariemont for a brief table
sitting. It lasted about ten minutes, between 12.10 and
12.20 p.m. And the test which he then and there suggested
was to ask Raymond to get Feda in London to say the
word "Honolulu." This task, I am told, was vigorously
accepted and acquiesced in.</p>

<p>A record of this short sitting Alec wrote on a letter-card
to me, which I received at 7 p.m. the same evening
at Mariemont: the first I had heard of the experiment.
The postmark is "1 p.m. 26 My 16," and the card runs
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[ 272]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">"<i>Mariemont, Friday, 26 May, 12.29 p.m.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"Honor, Rosalynde, and Alec sitting in drawing-room
at table. Knowing Lionel and Norah having Feda sitting
in London simultaneously. Asked Raymond to give our
love to Norah and Lionel and to try and get Feda to say
Honolulu. Norah and Lionel know nothing of this, as it
was arranged by A. M. L. after 12 o'clock to-day.</p>

<span style="margin-left:36em;"><span class="smcap">Rosalynde V. Lodge</span>"</span><br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is endorsed on the back in pencil, "Posted at B'ham
General P.O. 12.43 p.m."; and, in ink, "Received by me
7 p.m.&mdash;O. J. L. Opened and read and filed at once."</p>

<p>The sitters in London knew nothing of the contemporaneous
attempt; and nothing was told them, either then
or later. Noticing nothing odd in their sitting, which they
had not considered a particularly good one, they made no
report till after both had returned from Eastbourne a week
later.</p>

<p>The notes by that time had been written out, and were
given me to read to the family. As I read, I came on a
passage near the end, and, like the few others who were
in the secret, was pleased to find that the word "Honolulu"
had been successfully got through. The subject of
music appeared to have been rather forced in by Raymond,
in order to get Feda to mention an otherwise disconnected
and meaningless word; the time when this was managed
being, I <i>estimate</i>, about 1.0 or 1.15. But of course it was
not noted as of any interest at the time.</p>

<p>Here follow the London Notes. I will quote portions
of the sitting only, so as not to take up too much space:&mdash;

Friday, 26 May 1916, beginning 11.55 a.m.</i></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Extracts from Report by L. L.</span></h4>

<p>After referring to Raymond's married sister and her
husband, Feda suddenly ejaculated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>How is Alec?</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[ 273]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">L. L.</span>&mdash;Oh, all right.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>He just wanted to know how he was, and send
his love to him. He does not always see who is at
the table; he feels some more than others.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>He says you (to Norah) sat at the table and
Lionel.</p>

<p>He felt you (Norah) more than any one else at
the table.</p>

<p>[This is unlikely. He seems to be thinking that
it is Honor.]</p>

<p>Feda feels that if you started off very easily,
you would be able to see him. Develop a normal
... [clairvoyance probably].</p>

<p>Raymond says, go slowly, develop just with time,
go slowly. Even the table helps a little.</p>

<p>He can really get through now in his own words.
When he is there, he now knows what he has got
through.</p>

<p>The Indians have got through their hanky-panky.
[We thought that this meant playing with the table
in a way beyond his control.]</p>

<p>He says that Lily is here. (Feda, <i>sotto voce</i>.&mdash;Where
is she?)</p>

<p>She looks very beautiful, and has lilies; she will
help too, and give you power.</p>

<p>Sit quietly once or twice a week, hold your
hands, the right over the left, so, for ten minutes,
then sit quiet&mdash;only patience. He could wait till
doomsday.</p>

<p>He says, Wait and see; he is laughing!</p>

<p>He has seen Curly (p. <a href="#Page_203">203</a>).</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">L. L.</span>&mdash;Is Curly there now?</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>No, see her when we wants to. That's the one
that wriggles and goes ... (here Feda made a
sound like a dog panting, with her tongue out&mdash;quite
a good imitation).</p>

<p>Raymond has met another boy like Paul, a boy
called Ralph. He likes him. There is what you
call a set. People meet there who are interested in

<div class="blockreply5">
<p>(Feda, <i>sotto voce</i>.&mdash;She can't do that.)</p>

<p>He wanted to know whether you could play Hulu&mdash;Honolulu.</p>

<p>Well, can't you try to? He is rolling with laughter
[meaning that he's pleased about something].</p>

<p>He knows who he is speaking to, but he can't
give the name.</p>

<p>[Here he seems to know that it is Norah and not
Honor.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">L. L.</span>&mdash;Should I tell him?</p>

<p>He is going. Fondest love to them at Mariemont.</p>
</div>

<p>The sitting continued for a short time longer, ending
at 1.30 p.m., but the present report may end here.
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Note on the 'Honolulu' Episode by O. J. L.</span></h4>

<p>In my judgment there were signs that the simultaneous
holding of two sittings, one with Honor and Alec in Edgbaston,
and one with Lionel and Norah in London, introduced
a little harmless confusion; there was a tendency in
London to confuse Norah with Honor, and Alec was
mentioned in London in perhaps an unnecessary way. I
do not press this, however, but I do press the 'Honolulu'
episode&mdash;</p>

<ol class="rom">
  <li> because it establishes a reality about the home sittings,</li>
  <li> because it so entirely eliminates anything of
the nature of collusion, conscious or unconscious,</li>
  <li> because the whole circumstances of the test
make it an exceedingly good one.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[ 275]</a></span></p>

<p>What it does not exclude is telepathy. In fact it may
be said to suggest telepathy. Yes, it suggests distinctly
one variety of what, I think, is often called telepathy&mdash;a
process sometimes conducted, I suspect, by an unrecognised
emissary or messenger between agent and percipient. It
was exactly like an experiment conducted for thought
transference at a distance. For at Edgbaston was a party
of three sitting round a table and thinking for a few seconds
of the word 'Honolulu'; while in London was a party
of two simultaneously sitting with a medium and
recording what was said. And in their record the word
'Honolulu' occurs. Telepathy, however&mdash;of whatever
kind&mdash;is not a normal explanation; and I venture to
say that there is no normal explanation, since in my
judgment chance is out of the question. The subject
of music was forced in by the communicator, in order
to bring in the word; it did not occur naturally; and
even if the subject of music had arisen, there was
no sort of reason for referring to that particular song.
The chief thing that the episode establishes, to my mind,
and a thing that was worth establishing, is the genuine
character of the simple domestic sittings without a medium
which are occasionally held by the family circle at
Mariemont. For it is through these chiefly that Raymond
remains as much a member of the family group
as ever.
<br />

</p>

<h3>II. IMPROMPTU MARIEMONT SITTING</h3>

<p>Once at Mariemont, I am told, when M. F. A. L. and
Honor were touching it, the table moved up to a book
in which relics and reminiscences of Raymond had been
pasted, and caused it to be opened. In it, among other
things, was an enlargement of the snapshot facing page
278, showing him in an old 'Nagant' motor, which had
been passed on to him by Alec, stopping outside a certain
house in Somersetshire. He was asked what house it was,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[ 276]</a></span>
and was expected to spell the name of the friend who lived
there, but instead he spelt the name of the house. The
record by M. F. A. L., with some unimportant omissions,
is here reproduced&mdash;merely, however, as another example
of a private sitting without a medium.
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h4><i>Impromptu Table Sitting at Mariemont, Tuesday,
25 April 1916</i><br />
(<span class="smcap">Report by M. F. A. L.</span>)</h4>

<p>I had been thinking of Raymond all day, and wanting
to thank him for what he did yesterday for [a friend].
Honor had agreed that we might do it some time, but
when I mentioned it about 10.50 p.m., she did not want to
sit then&mdash;she thought it too late. We were then in the
library.</p>

<p>Honor, sitting on the Chesterfield, said, "I wonder if
any table would be equally good for Raymond?"&mdash;placing
her hands on the middle-sized table of the nest of three.
It at once began to stir, and she asked me to place mine on
the other side to steady it.</p>

<p>I asked if it was Raymond, and it decidedly said <span class="smcap">Yes</span>.</p>

<p>I then thanked him with much feeling for what he had
done for [two separate families] lately. I told him how
much he had comforted them, and how splendidly he was
doing; that there were quite a number of people he had
helped now. We discussed a few others that needed help.</p>

<p>Then I think we asked him if he knew what room we
were in&mdash;<span class="smcap">Yes</span>. And after knocking me a good deal, and
making a noise which seemed to please him against my
eyeglasses, he managed, by laying the table down, to get
one foot on to the Chesterfield and raise the table up on it;
and there it stayed, and rocked about for a long time
answering questions&mdash;I thought it would make a hole in
the cover.</p>

<p>I don't quite remember how it got down, but it did,
and then edged itself up to the other larger table, which
had been given me by Alec, No�l, and Raymond, after they
had broken a basket table I used to use there&mdash;it was
brought in with a paper, "To Mother from the culprits."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[ 277]</a></span>
(This was a year or two ago.) Well, he got it up to this
table, and fidgeted about with the foot of the smaller table
on which we had our hands, until he rested it on a ledge
and tried to raise it up. But the way he did this most
successfully was when he got the ledge of our small table
onto a corner of the other and then raised it off the ground
level. This he did several times. I took one hand off,
leaving one hand on the top, and Honor's two hands lying
on the top, <i>no part</i> of them being over the edge, and I
measured the height the legs were off the ground. The
first time it was the width of three fingers, and the next
time four fingers.</p>

<p>Honor told him this was very clever.</p>

<p>I then tried to press it down, but could not&mdash;a curious
feeling, like pressing on a cushion of air.</p>

<p>He had by this time turned us right round, so that
Honor was sitting where I had been before, and I was
sitting or sometimes standing in her place. Then we were
turned round again, and he seemed to want to knock the
other table again; he went at it in a curious way. I had
with one hand to remove a glass on it which I thought
he would upset. He continued to edge against it, until
he reached a book lying on it. This he knocked with such
intention, that Honor asked him if he wanted it opened.</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">Yes.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[This was a scrap-book in which I collect anything
about him&mdash;photographs, old and new;
poems made <i>about</i> him, or sent to me in consolation;
and it has his name outside, drawn
on in large letters.&mdash;M. F. A. L.]</span></p>
</div>

<p>So I opened it, and showed him the photograph of himself
seated in the 'Nagant.' [A motor-car which Alec had
practically given him not long before the war, and with
which he was delighted.]</p>

<p>Honor asked if he could see it, and he said <span class="smcap">Yes</span>, and
seemed pleased.</p>

<p>She asked if he could tell her what house it was standing
in front of, and he spelt out&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">ST. GERMINS.</span></p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">[This was pretty good, as the name of the

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span style="margin-left: -2em;">(Honor had forgotten the name till he began, and
expected him to say Jacques's.)</span></p>
</div>

<p>We told him he had got it, but that his spelling wasn't
quite as good as it had been.</p>

<p>Honor talked to him then about the 'Nagant' and the
'Gabrielle Horn,' all of which seemed to delight him.</p>

<p>We then showed him some other photographs, and the
one of his dog, and asked him to spell its name, which he
did without mistake&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockreply5">
<p><span class="smcap">LARRY.</span></p>
</div>

<p>He couldn't see the little photograph of the goats, as it
was too small. But he saw himself in uniform&mdash;the one
taken by Rosalynde and enlarged&mdash;and he seemed to like
seeing that.</p>

<p>We talked a lot to him. I asked if he remembered his
journey with me out to Italy, and the Pullman car, etc.
At this he knocked very affectionately against me.</p>

<p>We then thought it was time for us all to go to bed.
But he said <span class="smcap">No</span>. So we went on telling him family news.
He listened with interest and appreciative knocks, and he
then tried his balancing trick again, sometimes with success,
but often failing to get the leg right. But he did it
again in the end. We tried to say good night, it being then
nearly one o'clock, but he didn't seem to want to go.</p>

<p>We said au revoir, and told him we would see him
again soon.

<h3>III. EPISODE OF 'MR. JACKSON'</h3>

<p>A striking incident is reported in one of my 'Feda' sittings&mdash;that
on 3 March 1916&mdash;shortly after the death of
our peacock, which went by the comic name of 'Mr. Jackson,'
his wives being Matilda Jackson and Janet. He was
a pet of M. F. A. L.'s, and had recently met with a tragic
end. It was decided to have him stuffed, and one of the
last things I had seen before leaving Mariemont was a
wooden pedestal on which it was proposed to put him.</p>

<p>When I asked Feda if Raymond remembered Mr. Jackson,
he spoke of him humorously, greatly to Feda's puzzlement,
who said at last that he was mixing him up with a
bird, about whom I had previously inquired; because he
said, 'Fine bird, put him on a pedestal.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[ 279]</a></span></p>

<p>If this was not telepathy from me, it seems to show a
curious knowledge of what is going on at his home, for
the bird had not been dead a week, and if he were alive
there would be no sense in saying, 'put him on a pedestal.'
Feda evidently understood it, or tried to understand it, as
meaning that some man, a Mr. Jackson, was metaphorically
put on a pedestal by the family.</p>

<p>The fact, however, that Mr. Jackson was at once known
by Raymond to be a bird is itself evidential, for there was
nothing in the way I asked the question to make Feda or
anyone think he was not a man. Indeed, that is precisely
why she got rather bewildered. See <a href="#Page_237">Chapter XXI.</a>
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h3>IV. EPISODE OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS</h3>

<p>It is unnecessary to call attention to the importance of
the photograph incident, which is fully narrated in Chapter
IV; but he spoke later of another photograph, in which
he said was included his friend Case. It is mentioned near
the end of Chapter IV. That photograph we also obtained
from Gale &amp; Polden, and it is true that Case is in it as well
as Raymond, whereas he was not in the former group; but
this one is entirely different from the other, for they are
both in a back row standing up, and in a quite open place.
If this had been sent to us at first, instead of the right
one, we should have considered the description quite
wrong. As it is, the main photograph episode constitutes
one of the best pieces of evidence that has been
given.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3><span class="smcap">Remarks by O. J. L. in concluding Part II</span></h3>

<p>The number of more or less convincing proofs which
we have obtained is by this time very great. Some of them
appeal more to one person, some to another; but taking
them all together every possible ground of suspicion or
doubt seems to the family to be now removed. And it is
legitimate to say, further, that partly through Raymond's
activity a certain amount of help of the same kind has been
afforded to other families. Incidentally it has been difficult
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[ 280]</a></span>
to avoid brief reference to a few early instances of this,
in that part of the record now published. For the most
part, however, these and a great number of other things
are omitted; and I ought perhaps to apologise for the quantity
which I have thought proper to include. Some home
critics think that it would have been wiser to omit a great
deal more, so as to lighten the book. But one can only act
in accordance with one's own judgment; and the book, if
it is to achieve what it aims at, cannot be a light one. So,
instead of ending it here, I propose to add a quantity of
more didactic material&mdash;expressing my own views on the
subject of Life and Death&mdash;the result of many years of
thought and many kinds of experience.</p>

<p>Some people may prefer the details in Part II; but
others who have not the patience to read Part II may tolerate
the more general considerations adduced in Part III&mdash;the
"Life and Death" portion&mdash;which can be read without
any reference to Raymond or to Parts I and II.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN this "Life and Death" portion a definite side is unobtrusively
taken in connexion with two outstanding
controversies; and though the treatment is purposely
simple and uncontroversial, the author is under no delusion
that every philosophical reader will agree with him. Explicit
argumentation on either side is no novelty, but this is
not the place for argument; moreover, the opposing views
have already been presented with ample clearness by skilled
disputants.</p>

<p>Briefly then it may be said that Interactionism rather
than Epiphenomenalism or Parallelism is the side taken
in one controversy. And the non-material nature of life&mdash;the
real existence of some kind of vital essence or vivifying
principle as a controlling and guiding entity&mdash;is postulated
in another: though the author never calls it a force
or an energy.</p>

<p>Philosophical literature teems with these topics, but
it may suffice here to call the attention of the general
reader to two or three easily readable summaries&mdash;one an
explanatory article by Mr. Gerald Balfour, in <i>The Hibbert
Journal</i> for April 1910, on the Epiphenomenon controversy,
and generally on the alternative explanations of
the connexion between Mind and Body, in the light thrown
on the subject by Telepathy and Psychical Research; while
on the vitality controversy a small book embodying a short
course of lectures by the physiologist and philosopher Dr.
J. S. Haldane under the title <i>Mechanism, Life, and Personality</i>,
or a larger book by Professor M'Dougal called
<i>Body and Mind</i>, may be recommended. On this subject
also the writings of Professor J. Arthur Thomson may be
specially mentioned.</p>

<p>The opinions of the present author on these topics,
whatever they may be worth, are held without apology
or hesitation, because to him they appear the inevitable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[ 284]</a></span>
consequence of facts of nature as now known or knowable.
Some of these facts are not generally accepted by scientific
men; and if the facts themselves are not admitted, naturally
any conclusion based upon them will appear ill-founded,
and the further developed structure illusory. He anticipates
that this will be said by critics.</p>

<p>In so far as the author's manner of statement is in
terms of frank Dualism, he regards that as inevitable for
scientific purposes. He does not suppose that any form
of Dualism can be the last word about the Universe; but,
for practical purposes, mind and matter, or soul and
body, must be thought of separately, and it must be the
work of higher Philosophy to detect ultimate unity&mdash;a
unity which he feels certain cannot possibly be materialistic
in any sense intelligible to those who are at present
studying matter and energy.</p>

<p>It may be doubted whether Materialism as a philosophy
exists any longer, in the sense of being sustained by
serious philosophers; but a few physiological writers, of
skill and industry, continue to advocate what they are
pleased to call Scientific Materialism. Properly regarded
this is a Policy, not a Philosophy, as I will explain; but
they make the mistake of regarding it as a Philosophy
comprehensive enough to give them the right of negation
as well as of affirmation. They do this in the interest of
what they feel instinctively to be the ultimate achievement,
a Monism in which mind and matter can be recognised
as aspects of some one fundamental Reality. We can
sympathise with the aim, and still feel how far from accomplishment
we are. Nothing is gained by undue haste,
and by unfounded negation much may be lost. We must
not deny any part of the Universe for the sake of a premature
unification. Simplification by exclusion or denial
is a poverty-stricken device.</p>

<p>The strength of such workers is that they base themselves
on the experience and discoveries of the past, and,
by artificial but convenient limitation of outlook, achieve
practical results. But they are not satisfied with results
actually achieved&mdash;they forget their limitations&mdash;and, by
a gigantic system of extrapolation from what has been
done, try to infer what is going to be done; their device
being to anticipate and speak of what they hope for, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[ 285]</a></span>
if it were already an accomplished fact. Some of the
assumptions or blind guesses made by men of this school
are well illustrated by an exposition in <i>The Hibbert
Journal</i> for July 1916, where an able writer states the
main propositions of Scientific Materialism thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">1. The law of universal causation;</p>

<p class="p2">2. The principle of mechanism&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the denial of
purpose in the universe and all notions of
absolute finalism or teleology;</p>

<p class="p2">3. The denial that there exists any form of 'spiritual'
or 'mental' entity that cannot be expressed in terms of matter and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">motion.</span></p>

<p>These appear to be its three propositions, and they are
formulated by the exponent "as being of the first importance
in the representation of materialistic thought."</p>

<p>Now proposition 1 is common property; materialistic
thought has no sort of exclusive right over it; and to
claim propositions 2 and 3 as corollaries from it is farcical.
Taking them as independent postulates&mdash;which they are&mdash;all
that need be said about proposition 2 is that a broad
denial always needs more knowledge than a specific assertion,
and it is astonishing that any sane person can
imagine himself to know enough about the Universe as a
whole to be able complacently to deny the existence of
any "purpose" in it. All he can really mean is that
scientific explanations must be framed so as to exhibit
the immediate means whereby results in nature are accomplished;
for whether, or in what sense, they are first
or simultaneously conceived in a Mind&mdash;as human undertakings
are&mdash;is a matter beyond our scientific ken. Thus
Darwinian and Mendelian attempts to explain how species
arise, and how inheritance occurs, are entirely legitimate
and scientific. For our experience is that every event
has a proximate cause which we can investigate. Of
ultimate causes we as scientific men are ignorant: they
belong to a different region of inquiry. If the word
"denial," therefore, in the above proposition is replaced
by the phrase "exclusion from practical scientific attention,"
I for one have no quarrel with clause 2; for it
then becomes a mere self-denying ordinance, a convenient
limitation of scope. It represents Policy, not Philosophy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[ 286]</a></span></p>

<p>But attention may be more usefully directed to the
extravagantly gratuitous guess involved in hypothesis 3.
As a minor point, it is not even carefully worded; for
entities which cannot be expressed in terms of matter and
motion are common enough without going outside the
domain of physics. Light, for instance, and Electricity,
have not yet proved amenable, and do not appear likely
to be amenable, to purely dynamical theory.</p>

<p>Certain phenomena have been reduced to matter and
motion,&mdash;heat, for instance, and sound, the phenomena
of gases and liquids, and all the complexities of astronomy.
And in a famous passage Newton expressed an enthusiastic
hope that all the phenomena of physics might some
day be similarly reduced to the attractive simplicity of
the three laws of motion&mdash;inertia, acceleration, and
stress. And ever since Newton it has been the aim of
physics to explain everything in its domain in terms of
pure dynamics. The attempt has been only partially
successful: the Ether is recalcitrant. But its recalcitrance
is not like mere surly obstruction, it is of a helpful and
illuminating character, and I shall not be misleading anyone
if I cheerfully admit that in some modified and expanded
form dynamical theory in mathematical physics has proved
itself to be supreme.</p>

<p>But does dominance of that kind give to that splendid
science&mdash;the glory of Britain and of Cambridge&mdash;the right
to make a gigantic extrapolation and sprawl over all the
rest of the Universe, throwing out tentacles even into
regions which it has definitely abstracted from its attention
or excluded from its ken? There is not a physicist
who thinks so. The only people who try to think so
are a few enthusiasts of a more speculative habit of
thought, who are annoyed with the physicists, from Lord
Kelvin downwards, for not agreeing with them. And
being unable to gather from competent authority any
specific instance in which dynamics has explained a single
fact in the region of either life or mind or consciousness
or emotion or purpose or will,&mdash;because it is known perfectly
well that dynamical jurisdiction does not extend
into those regions,&mdash;these speculators set up as authorities
on their own account, and, on the strength of their own
expectation, propound the broad and sweeping dogma
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[ 287]</a></span>
that nothing in the Universe exists which is not fully
expressible in terms of matter and motion. And then,
having accustomed themselves to the sound of some such
collocation of words, they call upon humanity to shut its
eyes to any facts of common experience which render such
an assertion ridiculous.</p>

<p>The energy and enthusiasm of these writers, and the
good work they may be doing in their own science, render
them more or less immune from attack; but every now
and then it is necessary to say clearly that such extravagant
generalisations profane the modesty of science:
whose heritage it is to recognise the limitations of partial
knowledge, and to be always ready to gain fresh experience
and learn about the unknown. The new and unfamiliar
is the vantage ground, not of scientific dogmatism,
but of scientific inquiry.
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>The expository or theoretical part of this book may at
first appear too abstract for the general reader who has
had no experience of the kind of facts already described.
Such reader may fail to see a connexion between this
more didactic portion and the illustrations or examples
which have preceded it; but if he will give sufficient
time and thought to the subject, the connexion will dawn
upon him with considerable vividness.</p>

<p>It has always seemed to the author legitimate, and in
every way desirable, for an experimenter to interpret and
make himself responsible for an explanation or theory of
his observations, so far as he can. To record bare facts
and expect a reader of the record to arrive at the same
conclusion as that reached by one who has been immersed
in them for a long time, is to expect too strenuous an
effort, and is not a fair procedure. Such a practice,
though not unusual and sometimes even commended in
physical science, is not followed by the most famous
workers; and it has been known to retard progress for a
considerable time by loading the student with an accumulation
of undigested facts. The hypothesis on which an
observer has been working, or which he has arrived at in
the course of his investigations, may or may not be of
permanent value, but if his experience has led him to
regard it as the best solution so far attainable, and if he is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[ 288]</a></span>
known not to be a specially obstinate or self-opinionated
person, his views for what they are worth should be set
forth for the guidance of future inquirers. If he mauls
the facts in his direction, he will be detected; but such
an accusation is a serious one, and should not be made
lightly or without opportunity for reply.</p>

<p>The string on which beads are strung may not be
extremely durable, and in time it may give place to something
stronger, but it is better than a random heap of
beads not threaded on anything at all.</p>

<p>The main thread linking all the facts together in the
present case is the hypothesis not only of continued or
personal psychical existence in the abstract, but a definite
inter-locking or inter-communication between two grades of
existence,&mdash;the two in which we are most immediately
interested and about which we can ascertain most,&mdash;that
of the present and that of the immediate future for each
individual; together with the added probabilities that the
actual grades of existence are far more than two, and that
the forthcoming transition, in which we cannot but be
interested even if we do not believe in it, is only one of
many of which we shall, in some barely imaginable way,
in due time become aware.</p>

<p>The hypothesis of continued existence in another set
of conditions, and of possible communication across a
boundary, is not a gratuitous one made for the sake of
comfort and consolation, or because of a dislike to the idea
of extinction; it is a hypothesis which has been gradually
forced upon the author&mdash;as upon many other persons&mdash;by
the stringent coercion of definite experience. The
foundation of the atomic theory in Chemistry is to him no
stronger. The evidence is cumulative, and has broken
the back of all legitimate and reasonable scepticism.</p>

<p>And if by selecting the atomic theory as an example
he has chosen one upon which supplementary and most
interesting facts have been grafted in the progress of discovery&mdash;facts
not really contradicting the old knowledge,
even when superficially appearing to do so, but adding to
it and illuminating it further, while making changes perhaps
in its manner of formulation&mdash;he has chosen such
an example of set purpose, as not unlikely to be imitated in
the present case also.</p>

<span class="small">THE MEANING OF THE TERM LIFE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="center">"Eternal process moving on."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tennyson</span>
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE shorter the word the more inevitable it is that
it will be used in many significations; as can be
proved by looking out almost any monosyllable in
a large dictionary. The tendency of a simple word to
have many glancing meanings&mdash;like shot silk, as Tennyson
put it&mdash;is a character of high literary value; though it
may be occasionally inconvenient for scientific purposes.
It is unlikely that we can escape an ambiguity due to this
tendency, but I wish to use the term 'life' to signify the
vivifying principle which animates matter.</p>

<p>That the behaviour of animated matter differs from
what is often called dead matter is familiar, and is illustrated
by the description sometimes given of an uncanny
piece of mechanism&mdash;that "it behaves as if it were alive."
In the case of a jumping bean, for instance, its spasmodic
and capricious behaviour can be explained with apparent
simplicity, though with a suspicious trend towards superstition,
by the information that a live and active maggot
inhabits a cavity inside. It is thereby removed from the
bare category of physics only, though still perfectly obedient
to physical laws: it jumps in accordance with
mechanics, but neither the times nor the direction of its
jumps can be predicted.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>We must admit that the term 'dead matter' is often
misapplied. It is used sometimes to denote merely the
constituents of the general inorganic world. But it is
inconvenient to speak of utterly inanimate things, like
stones, as 'dead,' when no idea of life was ever associated
with them, and when 'inorganic' is all that is meant.
The term 'dead' applied to a piece of matter signifies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[ 290]</a></span>
the absence of a vivifying principle, no doubt, but it is
most properly applied to a collocation of organic matter
which has been animated.</p>

<p>Again, when animation has ceased, the thing we
properly call dead is not the complete organism, but that
material portion which is left behind; we do not or should
not intend to make any assertion concerning the vivifying
principle which has left it,&mdash;beyond the bare fact of its
departure. We know too little about that principle to be
able to make safe general assertions. The life that is
transmitted by an acorn or other seed fruit is always
beyond our ken. We can but study its effects, and note
its presence or its absence by results.</p>

<p>Life must be considered <i>sui generis</i>; it is not a form of
energy, nor can it be expressed in terms of something else.
Electricity is in the same predicament; it too cannot be
explained in terms of something else. This is true of all
fundamental forms of being. Magnetism may be called a
concomitant of moving electricity; ordinary matter can
perhaps be resolved into electric charges: but an electric
charge can certainly not be expressed in terms of either
matter or energy. No more can life. To show that the
living principle in a seed is not one of the forms of energy,
it is sufficient to remember that that seed can give rise to
innumerable descendants, through countless generations,
without limit. There is nothing like a constant quantity
of something to be shared, as there is in all examples of
energy: there is no conservation about it: the seed embodies
a stimulating and organising principle which
appears to well from a limitless source.</p>

<p>But although life is not energy, any more than it is
matter, yet it directs energy and thereby controls arrangements
of matter. Through the agency of life specific
structures are composed which would not otherwise exist,
from a sea-shell to a cathedral, from a blade of grass to
an oak; and specific distributions of energy are caused,
from the luminosity of a firefly to an electric arc, from the
song of a cricket to an oratorio.</p>

<p>Life makes use of any automatic activities, or transferences
and declensions of energy, which are either
potentially or actually occurring. In especial it makes
use of the torrent of ether tremors which reach the earth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[ 291]</a></span>
from the sun. Every plant is doing it constantly. Admittedly
life exerts no force, it does no work, but it
makes effective the energy available for an organism which
it controls and vivifies; it determines in what direction
and when work shall be done. It is plain matter of
fact that it does this, whether we understand the method
or not,&mdash;and thus indirectly life interacts with and influences
the material world. The energy of coal is indirectly
wholly solar, but without human interference it
might remain buried in the earth, and certainly would
never propel a ship across the Atlantic. One way of
putting the matter is to say that life <i>times</i>, and <i>directs</i>.
If it runs a railway train, it runs the train not like a locomotive
but like a General Manager. It enters into battle
with a walking-stick, but guns are fired to its orders. It
may be said to aim and fire: one of its functions is to discriminate
between the wholesome and the deleterious,
between friend and foe. That is a function outside the
scope of physics.</p>

<p>Energy controlled by life is not random energy: the
kind of self-composition or personal structure built by it
depends on the kind of life-unit which is operating, not on
the pabulum which is supplied. The same food will serve to
build a pig, a chicken, or a man. Food which is assimilable
at all takes a shape determined by the nature of the operative
organism, and indeed by the portion of the organism
actually reached by it. Unconscious constructive ability
is as active in each cell of the body as in a honeycomb;
only in a beehive we can see the operators at work.
The construction of an eye or an ear is still more astonishing.
In the inorganic world such structures would be
meaningless, for there would be nothing to respond to
their stimulus; they can only serve elementary mind and
consciousness. The brain and nerve system is an instrument
of transmutation or translation from the physical to
the mental, and <i>vice versa</i>.

<h3>THREE EXPLANATORY NOTES</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Note A.&mdash;Mechanics of Jumping Bean</span></h4>

<p>The biological explanation of a jumping bean is sometimes
felt to be puzzling, inasmuch as the creature is wholly enclosed;
and a man in a boat knows that he cannot propel it by movement
inside, without touching the water or something external. But
the reaction of a table can be made use of through the envelope,
and a live thing can momentarily vary its own weight-pressure
and even reverse its sign. This fact has a bearing on some
psycho-physical experiments, and hence is worthy of a moment's
attention.</p>

<p>To weigh an animal that jumps and will not keep still is
always troublesome. It cannot alter its average weight, truly,
but it can redistribute it in time; at moments its apparent weight
may be excessive, and at other moments zero or even negative,
as during the middle of an energetic leap. Parenthetically we
may here interpolate a remark and say that what is called interference
of light (two lights producing darkness, in popular language)
is a redistribution of luminous energy in space. No light,
nor any kind of wave motion, is destroyed by interference when
two sets of waves overlap, but the energy rises to a maximum
in some places, and in other places sinks to zero. No wave energy
is consumed by interference&mdash;only rearranged. This fact is often
misstated. And probably the other statement, about the varying
apparent weight&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> pressure on the ground&mdash;of a live animal,
may be misstated too: though there is no question of energy
about that, but only of force. The force or true weight, in the
sense of the earth's attraction, is there all the time, and is constant;
but the pressure on the ground, or the force needed to counteract
the weight, is not constant. After momentary violence, as in
throwing, no support need be supplied for several seconds; and,
like the maggot inside a hollow bean, a live thing turning itself
into a projectile may even carry something else up too. It
is instructive also to consider a flying bird, and a dirigible balloon,
and to ask where the still existing weight of these things can be
found.

<h4><span class="smcap">Note B.&mdash;Differences between a Growing Organism and a<br />
Growing Crystal</span></h4>

<p>The properties which differentiate living matter from any
kind of inorganic imitation may be instinctively felt, but can
hardly be formulated without expert knowledge. The differences
between a growing organism and a growing crystal are many and
various, but it must suffice here to specify the simplest and most
familiar sort of difference; and as it is convenient to take a
possibly controversial statement of this kind from the writings of a
physiologist, I quote here a passage from an article by Professor
Fraser Harris, of Halifax, Nova Scotia, in the current number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[ 294]</a></span>
the quarterly magazine called <i>Science Progress</i> edited by Sir
Ronald Ross&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Living animal bioplasm has the power of growing, that is
of assimilating matter in most cases chemically quite unlike that
of its own constitution. Now this is a remarkable power, not in
the least degree shared by non-living matter. Its very familiarity
has blinded us to its uniqueness as a chemical phenomenon. The
mere fact that a man eating beef, bird, fish, lobster, sugar, fat, and
innumerable other things can transform these into human bioplasm,
something chemically very different even from that of
them which most resembles human tissue, is one of the most
extraordinary facts in animal physiology. A crystal growing in a
solution is not only not analogous to this process, it is in the
sharpest possible contrast with it. The crystal grows only in the
sense that it increases in bulk by accretions to its exterior, and
only does that by being immersed in a solution of the same material
as its own substance. It takes up to itself only material which is
already similar to itself; this is not assimilation, it is merely
incorporation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"The term 'growth,' strictly speaking, can be applied only
to metabolism in the immature or convalescent organism. The
healthy adult is not 'growing' in this sense; when of constant
weight he is adding neither to his stature nor his girth, and yet
he is assimilating as truly as ever he did. Put more technically:
in the adult of stationary weight, anabolism is quantitatively
equal to katabolism, whereas in the truly growing organism anabolism
is prevailing over katabolism; and reversely in the wasting
of an organism or in senile decay, katabolism is prevailing over
anabolism. The crystal in its solution offers no analogies with the
adult or the senile states&mdash;but these are of the very essence of the
life of an organism....</p>

<p>"The fact, of course familiar to every beginner in biology, is
that the crystal is only incorporating and not excreting anything,
whereas the living matter is always excreting as well as assimilating.
This one-sided metabolism&mdash;if it can be dignified with
that term&mdash;is indeed characteristic of the crystal, but it is at
no time characteristic of the living organism. The organism,
whether truly growing or only in metabolic equilibrium, is constantly
taking up material to replace effete material, is replenishing
because it has previously displenished itself or cast off material.
The resemblance between a so-called 'growing' crystal and a growing
organism is verily of the most superficial kind."</p>

<p>And Professor Fraser Harris concludes his article thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Between the living and the non-living there is a great gulf
fixed, and no efforts of ours, however heroic, have as yet bridged
it over."
<br />
<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><span class="smcap">Note C.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Old Age</span></h4>

<p>We know that as vitality diminishes the bodily deterioration
called old age sets in, and that a certain amount of deterioration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
results in death; but it turns out, on systematic inquiry, that old
age and death are not essential to living organisms. They represent
the deterioration and wearing out of working parts, so that
the vivifying principle is hampered in its manifestation and cannot
achieve results which with a younger and healthier machine were
possible; but the parts which wear out are not the essential
bearers of the vivifying principle; they are accreted or supplementary
portions appropriate to developed individual earth life,
and it does not appear improbable that the progress of discovery
may at least postpone the deterioration that we call old age, for a
much longer time than at present. Emphasis on this distinction
between germ cell and body cell, usually associated with Weismann,
seems to have been formulated before him by Herdman of
Liverpool.</p>

<p>Biologists teach us that the phenomenon of old age is not
evident in the case of the unicellular organisms which reproduce
by fission. The cell can be killed, but it need neither grow old nor
die. Death appears to be a prerogative of the higher organisms.
But even among these Professor Weismann adopts and defends
the view that "death is not a primary necessity, but that it has
been secondarily acquired by adaptation." The cell is not inherently
limited in its number of cell-generations. The low unicellular
organism is potentially immortal; the higher multicellular
form, with well-differentiated organs, contains the germ of
death within its <i>soma</i>. Death seems to supervene by reason of its
utility to the species: continued life of an individual after a
certain stage being comparatively useless. From the point of
view of the race the soma or main body is "a secondary appendage
of the real bearer of life&mdash;the reproductive cells." The somatic
cells probably lost their immortal qualities on this immortality
becoming useless to the species. Their mortality may have been
a mere consequence of their differentiation. "Natural death was
not introduced from absolute intrinsic necessity, inherent in the
nature of living matter," says Weismann, "but on grounds of
utility; that is from necessities which sprang up, not from the
general conditions of life, but from those special conditions which
dominate the life of multicellular organisms."</p>

<p>It is not the germ cell itself, but the bodily accretion or appendage,
which is abandoned by life, and which accordingly dies and
decays.</p>

<span class="small">THE MEANING OF THE TERM DEATH</span>
</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">"And Life, still wreathing flowers for Death to wear."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rossetti</span>
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WHATEVER Life may really be, it is to us an
abstraction: for the word is a generalised term
to signify that which is common to all animals
and plants, and which is not directly operative in the inorganic
world. To understand life we must study living
things, to see what is common to them all. An organism
is alive when it moulds matter to a characteristic form, and
utilises energy for its own purposes&mdash;the purposes especially
of growth and reproduction. A living organism, so
far as it is alive, preserves its complicated structure from
deterioration and decay.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Death is the cessation of that controlling influence over
matter and energy, so that thereafter the uncontrolled activity
of physical and chemical forces supervene. Death is not
the absence of life merely, the term signifies its departure
or separation, the severance of the abstract principle from
the concrete residue. The term only truly applies to that
which has been living.</p>

<p>Death therefore may be called a dissociation, a dissolution,
a separation of a controlling entity from a physicochemical
organism; it may be spoken of in general and
vague terms as a separation of soul and body, if the term
'soul' is reduced to its lowest denomination.</p>

<p>Death is not extinction. Neither the soul nor the body
is extinguished or put out of existence. The body weighs
just as much as before, the only properties it loses at the
moment of death are potential properties. So also all we
can assert concerning the vital principle is that it no longer
animates that material organism: we cannot safely make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[ 297]</a></span>
further assertion regarding it, or maintain its activity or its
inactivity without further information.</p>

<p>When we say that a body is dead we may be speaking
accurately. When we say that a <i>person</i> is dead, we are
using an ambiguous term; we may be referring to his
discarded body, in which case we may be speaking truly
and with precision. We may be referring to his personality,
his character, to what is really himself; in which case
though we must admit that we are speaking popularly,
the term is not quite simply applicable. He has
gone, he has passed on, he has "passed through the body
and gone," as Browning says in <i>Abt Vogler</i>, but he is&mdash;I
venture to say&mdash;certainly not dead in the same sense as
the body is dead. It is his absence which allows the body
to decay, he himself need be subject to no decay nor any
destructive influence. Rather he is emancipated; he is freed
from the burden of the flesh, though with it he has also
lost those material and terrestrial potentialities which the
bodily mechanism conferred upon him; and if he can exert
himself on the earth any more, it can only be
with some difficulty and as it were by permission and
co-operation of those still here. It appears as if sometimes
and occasionally he can still stimulate into activity
suitable energetic mechanism, but his accustomed machinery
for manifestation has been lost: or rather it is still there
for a time, but it is out of action, it is dead.</p>

<p>Nevertheless inasmuch as those who have lost their
material body have passed through the process of dissolution
or dissociative severance which we call death, it
is often customary to speak of them as dead. They are
no longer living, if by living we mean associated with a
material body of the old kind; and in that sense we need
not hesitate to speak of them collectively as 'the
dead.'</p>

<p>We need not be afraid of the word, nor need we resent
its use or hesitate to employ it, when once we and our hearers
understand the sense in which it may rightly be employed.
If ideas associated with the term had always been
sensible and wholesome, people need have had no compunction
at all about using it. But by the populace, and by
Ecclesiastics also, the term has been so misused, and the
ideas of people have been so confused by insistent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[ 298]</a></span>
concentration on merely physical facts, and by the necessary
but over-emphasised attention to the body left behind,
that it was natural for a time to employ other words, until
the latent ambiguity had ceased to be troublesome.
And occasionally, even now, it is well to be emphatic in
this direction, in order to indicate our disagreement
with the policy of harping on worms and graves and
epitaphs, or on the accompanying idea of a General
Resurrection, with reanimation of buried bodies. Hence
in strenuous contradiction to all this superstition comes the
use of such phrases as 'transition' or 'passing,' and the occasional
not strictly justifiable assertion that "there is no
death."</p>

<p>For as a matter of familiar fact death there certainly
is; and to deny a fact is no assistance. No one really
means to deny a fact; those who make the statement
only want to divert thoughts from a side already too
much emphasised, and to concentrate attention on another
side. What they mean is, there is no extinction.
They definitely mean to maintain that the process called
death is a mere severence of soul and body, and that the
soul is freed rather than injured thereby. The body alone
dies and decays; but there is no extinction even for it&mdash;only
a change. For the other part there can hardly be
even a change&mdash;except a change of surroundings. It is
unlikely that character and personality are liable to sudden
revolutions or mutations. Potentially they may be different,
because of different opportunities, but actually
at the moment they are the same. Likening existence to
a curve, the curvature has changed, but there is no other
discontinuity.</p>

<p>Death is not a word to fear, any more than birth is.
We change our state at birth, and come into the world of
air and sense and myriad existence; we change our state
at death and enter a region of&mdash;what? Of Ether, I
think, and still more myriad existence; a region in which
communion is more akin to what we here call telepathy,
and where intercourse is not conducted by the accustomed
indirect physical processes; but a region in which beauty
and knowledge are as vivid as they are here: a region in
which progress is possible, and in which "admiration, hope,
and love" are even more real and dominant. It is in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[ 299]</a></span>
sense that we can truly say, "The dead are not dead, but
alive." &omicron;&#8059;&delta;&#941; &tau;&epsilon;&theta;&nu;&#8119;&sigma;&iota;

<h3>APPENDIX ON FEELINGS WHEN DEATH IS<br />
IMMINENT</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Preliminary Statement by O. J. L.</span></h3>

<p>A lady was brought by a friend to call on us at Mariemont
during a brief visit to Edgbaston, and I happened to have a talk
with her in the garden. I found that she had been one of the
victims of the <i>Lusitania</i>, and as she seemed very cheerful and
placid about it, I questioned her as to her feelings on the occasion.
I found her a charming person, and she entered into the matter
with surprising fulness, considering that she was a complete
stranger. Her chief anxiety seems to have been for her husband,
whom she had left either in America or the West Indies, and for
her friends generally; but on her own behalf she seems to have
felt extremely little anxiety or discomfort of any kind. She told
me she had given up hope of being saved, and was only worried
about friends mourning on her behalf and thinking that she must
have suffered a good deal, whereas, in point of fact, she was not
really suffering at all. She was young and healthy, and apparently
felt no evil results from the three hours' immersion. She
was sucked down by the ship, and when she came to the surface
again, her first feeling was one of blank surprise at the disappearance
of what had brought her across the Atlantic. The ship was
"not there."</p>

<p>I thought her account so interesting, that after a few months
I got her address from the friend with whom she had been staying,
and wrote asking if she would write it down for me. In due
course she did so, writing from abroad, and permits me to make
use of the statement, provided I suppress her name; which accordingly
I do, quoting the document otherwise in full.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Document referred to</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Your letter came to me as a great pleasure and surprise.
I have always remembered the sympathy with which you listened
to me, that morning at Edgbaston, and sometimes wondered at the
amount I said, as it is not easy to give expression to feelings and
speculations which are only roused at critical moments in one's
life.</p>

<p>"What you ask me to do is not easy, as I am only one of those
who are puzzling and groping in the dark&mdash;while you have found
so much light for yourself and have imparted it to others.</p>

<p>"I would like, however, most sincerely to try to recall my
sensations with regard to that experience, if they would be of any
value to you.</p>

<p>"It would be absurd to say now, that from the beginning of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[ 300]</a></span>
voyage I knew what would happen; it was not a very actual
knowledge, but I was conscious of a distinct forewarning, and the
very calmness and peace of the voyage seemed, in a way, a state of
waiting for some great event. Therefore when the ship was rent
by the explosion (it was as sudden as the firing of a pistol) I felt no
particular shock, because of that curious inner expectancy. The
only acute feeling I remember at the moment was one of anger
that such a crime could have been committed; the fighting instinct
predominated in the face of an unseen but near enemy. I
sometimes think it was partly that same instinct&mdash;the desire to
die game&mdash;that accounted for the rather grim calmness of some of
the passengers. After all&mdash;it was no ordinary shipwreck, but a
Chance of War. I put down my book and went round to the
other side of the ship where a great many passengers were gathering
round the boats; it was difficult to stand, as the <i>Lusitania</i> was
listing heavily. There seemed to be no panic whatever; I went
into my cabin, a steward very kindly helped me with a life-jacket,
and advised me to throw away my fur coat. I felt no hurry or
anxiety, and returned on deck, where I stood with some difficulty&mdash;
discussing our chances with an elderly man I just knew by sight.</p>

<p>"It was then I think we realised what a strong instinct there
was in some of us&mdash;<i>not</i> to struggle madly for life&mdash;but to wait for
something to come to us, whether it be life or death; and not to
lose our personality and become like one of the struggling shouting
creatures who were by then swarming up from the lower decks
and made one's heart ache. I never felt for a moment that my
time to cross over had come&mdash;not until I found myself in the
water&mdash;floating farther and farther away from the scene of wreckage
and misery&mdash;in a sea as calm and vast as the sky overhead. Behind
me, the cries of those who were sinking grew fainter, the
splash of oars and the calls of those who were doing rescue work
in the lifeboats; there seemed to be no possibility of rescue for
me; so I reasoned with myself and said, 'The time <i>has</i> come&mdash;you
must believe it&mdash;the time to cross over'&mdash;but inwardly and persistently
something continued to say, 'No&mdash;not now.'</p>

<p>"The gulls were flying overhead and I remember noticing the
beauty of the blue shadows which the sea throws up to their white
feathers: they were very happy and alive and made me feel
rather lonely; my thoughts went to my people&mdash;looking forward
to seeing me, and at that moment having tea in the garden at
&mdash;&mdash; the idea of their grief was unbearable&mdash;I had to cry a
little. Names of books went through my brain;&mdash;one specially,
called 'Where no Fear is,' seemed to express my feeling at the
time! Loneliness, yes, and sorrow on account of the grief of
others&mdash;but no Fear. It seemed very normal,&mdash;very right,&mdash;a
natural development of some kind about to take place. How can
it be otherwise, when it <i>is</i> natural? I rather wished I knew some
one on the other side, and wondered if there are friendly strangers
there who come to the rescue. I was very near the border-line
when a wandering lifeboat quietly came up behind me and two
men bent down and lifted me in. It was extraordinary how
quickly life came rushing back;&mdash;every one in the boat seemed very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[ 301]</a></span>
self-possessed&mdash;although there was one man dead and another
losing his reason. One woman expressed a hope for a 'cup of
tea' shortly&mdash;a hope which was soon to be realised for all of us in
a Mine Sweeper from Queenstown. I have forgotten her name&mdash;but
shall always remember the kindness of her crew&mdash;specially the
Chief Officer, who saved me much danger by giving me dry clothes
and hot towels.</p>

<p>"All this can be of very little interest to you&mdash;I have no skill
in putting things on paper;&mdash;but, you know. I am glad to have
been near the border; to have had the feeling of how very near it
is <i>always</i>&mdash;only there are so many little things always going on to

<p>"Others on that day were passing through a Gate which was not
open for me&mdash;but I do not expect they were afraid when the time
came&mdash;they too probably felt that whatever they were to find
would be beautiful&mdash;only a fulfilment of some kind.... I have
reason to think that the passing from here is very painless&mdash;at
least when there is no illness. We seemed to be passing through a
stage on the road of Life."</p>

<p class="center">"All, that doth live, lives always!"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Edwin Arnold</span>
<br />

</p>

<p class="drop-cap">CONSIDER now the happenings to the discarnate
body. In the first place, I repeat, it is undesirable
to concentrate attention on a grave. The discarnate
body must be duly attended to when done with; the safety
of the living is a paramount consideration; the living must
retain control over what is dead. Uncontrolled natural
forces are often dangerous: the only thing harmful about
a flood or a fire is the absence of control. Either the operations
must be supervised and intelligently directed, or
they must be subjected to such disabilities that they can do
no harm. But to associate continued personality with a
dead body, such as is suggested by phrases like "lay him
in the earth", or "here lies such an one," or to anticipate
any kind of physical resuscitation, is unscientific and painful.
Unfortunately the orthodox religious world at some
epochs has attached superstitious importance, not to the
decent disposal, but to the imagined future of the body.
Painful and troublesome to humanity those rites have
been. The tombs of Egypt are witness to the harassing
need felt by the living to provide their loved ones with
symbols or tokens of all that they might require in a future
state of existence,&mdash;as if material things were needed by
them any more, or as if we could provide them if they
were.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
The simple truth is always so much saner and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[ 303]</a></span>
happier than the imaginings of men; or, as Dr. Schuster
said in his Presidential address to the British Association
at Manchester, 1915,&mdash;"The real world is far more beautiful
than any of our dreams."</p>

<p>What is the simple truth? It can be regarded from two
points of view, the prosaic and the poetic.</p>

<p>Prosaically we can say that the process of decay, if
regarded scientifically, is not in itself necessarily repugnant.
It may be as interesting as fermentation or any other
chemical or biological process. Putrefaction, like poison,
is hostile to higher living organisms, and hence a self-protecting
feeling of disgust has arisen round it, in the
course of evolution. An emotional feeling arises in the
mind of anyone who has to combat any process or operation
of nature,&mdash;like the violent emotions excited in an
extreme teetotaller by the word 'drink': a result of the
evil its profanation has done; for the verb itself is surely
quite harmless. Presumably a criminal associates disagreeable
anticipations with the simple word 'hanging.'
The idea of a rank weed is repulsive to a gardener, but not
to a botanist; the idea of disease is repellent to a prospective
patient, not to a doctor or bacteriologist; the
idea of dirt is objectionable to a housewife, but it is only
matter out of place; the word 'poison' conveys nothing
objectionable to a chemist. Everything removed from
the emotional arena, and transplanted into the intellectual,
becomes interesting and tractable and worthy of study.
Living organisms of every kind are good in themselves,
though when out of place and beyond control they may
be harmful. A tiger is an object of dread to an Indian
village: to a hunting party he may be keenly attractive.
In any case he is a lithe and beautiful and splendid
creature. Microscopic organisms may have troublesome
and destructive effects, but in themselves they can be
studied with interest and avidity. All living creatures
have their assuredly useful function, only it may be a
function on which we naturally shrink from dwelling when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[ 304]</a></span>
in an emotional mood. Everything of this kind is an
affair of mood; and, properly regarded, nothing in nature
is common or unclean. That a flying albatross is a
beautiful object every one can cordially admit, but that
the crawling surface of a stagnant sea can be regarded
with friendly eyes seems an absurdity; yet there is
nothing absurd in it. It is surely the bare truth concerning
all living creatures of every grade, that "the Lord God
made them all"; and it was of creeping water-snakes that
the stricken Mariner at length, when he had learnt the
lesson, ejaculated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem width24">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"O happy living things!</p>
<p>A spring of love gushed from my heart,</p>
<p>And I blessed them unaware."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>For what can be said poetically about the fate of
the beloved body, the poets themselves must be appealed
to. But that there is kinship between the body and the
earth is literal truth. Of terrestrial particles it is wholly
composed, and that they should be restored to the earth
whence they were borrowed is natural and peaceful.
Moreover, out of the same earth, and by aid of the very
same particles, other helpful forms of life may arise;
and though there may be no conscious unification or real
identity, yet it is pardonable to associate, in an imaginative
and poetic mood, the past and future forms assumed by the
particles:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem width24">
<div class="stanza">
<p><span style="margin-left: 7em;">"Lay her i' the earth;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>And from her fair and unpolluted flesh,</p>
<p>May violets spring!"</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Quotations are hardly necessary to show that this idea
runs through all poetry. An ancient variety is enshrined
in the Hyacinthus and Adonis legends. From spilt blood
an inscribed lily springs, in the one tale; and the
other we may quote in Shakespeare's version (<i>Venus and
Adonis</i>):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem width24">
<div class="stanza">
<p><span style="margin-left: -0.35em;">"And in his blood that on the ground lay spilled,</span></p>
<p>A purple flower sprung up chequered with white,</p>
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood</span></p>
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood."</span></p>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[ 305]</a></span></p>

<p>So also Tennyson:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem width24">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"And from his ashes may be made</p>
<p>The violet of his native land."</p>
<p><span style="margin-left:10em;"><i>In Memoriam</i></span></p>
</div></div></div>

<p>We find the same idea again, I suppose, in the eastern
original of Fitzgerald's well-known stanza:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem width24">
<div class="stanza">
<p><span style="margin-left: -0.35em;">"And this delightful Herb whose tender Green</span></p>
<p>Fledges the River's Lip on which we lean&mdash;</p>
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah, lean upon it lightly! for who knows</span></p>
<p>From what once lovely Lip it springs unseen!"</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The soil of a garden is a veritable charnel-house of
vegetable and animal matter, and from one point of
view represents death and decay, but the coltsfoot covering
an abandoned heap of refuse, or the briar growing
amid ruin, shows that Nature only needs time to make
it all beautiful again. Let us think of the body as transmuted,
not as stored.</p>

<p>The visible shape of the body was no accident, it
corresponded to a reality, for it was caused by the indwelling
vivifying essence; and affection entwines itself
inevitably round not only the true personality of the departed,
but round its material vehicle also&mdash;the sign and
symbol of so much beauty, so much love. Symbols
appeal to the heart of humanity, and anything cherished
and honoured becomes in itself a thing of intrinsic value,
which cannot be regarded with indifference. The old and
tattered colours of a regiment, for which men have laid
down their lives&mdash;though replaced perhaps by something
newer and more durable&mdash;cannot be relegated to
obscurity without a pang. And any sensitive or sympathetic
person, contemplating such relics hereafter, may
feel some echo of the feeling with which they were regarded,
and may become acquainted with their history
and the scenes through which they have passed.
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>In such cases the kind of knowledge to be gained
from the relic, and the means by which additional information
can be acquired, are intelligible; but in other cases also
information can be attained, though by means at present
not understood. It may sound superstitious, but it is a
matter of actual experience, that some sensitives have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[ 306]</a></span>
intuitive perception, of an unfamiliar kind, concerning
the history and personal associations of relics or fragments
or personal belongings. The faculty is called
psychometry; and it is no more intelligible, although no
less well-evidenced, than the possibly allied faculty of
dowsing or so-called water-divining. Psychometry is a
large subject on which much has already been written:
this brief mention must here suffice.</p>

<p>It seems to me that these facts, when at length properly
understood, will throw some light on the connexion between
mind and matter; and then many another obscure
region of semi-science and semi-superstition will be illuminated.
At present in all such tracts we have to walk warily,
for the ground is uneven and insecure; and it is better, or
at least safer, for the majority to forgo the recognition
of some truth than rashly to invade a district full of
entanglements and pitfalls.
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Transition</span></h3>

<p>Longfellow's line, "There is no death; what seems so
is transition," at once suggests itself. Read literally the
first half of this sentence is obviously untrue, but in the
sense intended, and as a whole, the statement is true
enough. There is no extinction, and the change called
death is the entrance to a new condition of existence&mdash;what
may be called a new life.</p>

<p>Yet life itself is continuous, and the conditions of the
whole of existence remain precisely as before. Circumstances
have changed for the individual, but only in the
sense that he is now aware of a different group of facts.
The change of surroundings is a subjective one. The facts
were of course there, all the time, as the stars are there in
the daytime; but they were out of our ken. Now these
come into our ken, and others fade into memory.</p>

<p>The Universe is one, not two. Literally there is no
'other' world&mdash;except in the limited and partial sense of
other planets&mdash;the Universe is one. We exist in it continuously
all the time; sometimes conscious in one way,
sometimes conscious in another; sometimes aware of a
group of facts on one side of a partition, sometimes aware
of another group, on the other side. But the partition is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[ 307]</a></span>
a subjective one; we are all one family all the time, so
long as the link of affection is not broken. And for those
who believe in prayer at all to cease from praying for the
welfare of their friends because they are materially inaccessible&mdash;though
perhaps spiritually more accessible
than before&mdash;is to succumb unduly to the residual evil of
past ecclesiastical abuses, and to lose an opportunity of
happy service.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Difficulty of Belief in Continued Existence</span></h3>

<p>"Sit down before fact as a little child, be prepared to give
up every preconceived notion, follow humbly wherever and to
whatsoever abysses Nature leads."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Huxley.</span></p>

<p class="drop-cap">PEOPLE often feel a notable difficulty in believing
in the reality of continued existence. Very likely
it is difficult to believe or to realise existence in
what is sometimes called "the next world"; but then,
when we come to think of it, it is difficult to believe in
existence in this world too; it is difficult to believe in
existence at all. The whole problem of existence is a
puzzling one. It could by no means have been predicated
<i>a priori</i>. The whole thing is a question of experience;
that is, of evidence. We know by experience that things
actually do exist; though how they came into being, and
what they are all for, and what consequences they have,
is more than we can tell. We have no reason for asserting
that the kind we are familiar with is the only kind of
existence possible, unless we choose to assert it on the
ground that we have no experience of any other. But
that is becoming just the question at issue: have we any
evidence, either direct or indirect, for any other existence
than this? If we have, it is futile to cite in opposition to
it the difficulty of believing in the reality of such an
existence; we surely ought to be guided by facts.</p>

<p>At this stage in the history of the human race few facts
of science are better established and more widely appreciated
than the main facts of Astronomy: a general acquaintance
with the sizes and distances, and the enormous
number, of the solar systems distributed throughout space<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[ 309]</a></span>
is prevalent. Yet to the imaginative human mind the
facts, if really grasped, are overwhelming and incredible.</p>

<p>The sun a million times bigger than the earth; Arcturus
a hundred times bigger than the sun, and so distant
that light has taken two centuries to come, though
travelling at a rate able to carry it to New York and back
in less than the twentieth part of a second,&mdash;facts like
these are commonplaces of the nursery; but even as bare
facts they are appalling.</p>

<p>That the earth is a speck invisible from any one of the
stars, that we are on a world which is but one among an
innumerable multitude of others, ought to make us realise
the utter triviality of any view of existence based upon
familiarity with street and train and office, ought to give
us some sense of proportion between everyday experience
and ultimate reality. Even the portentous struggle in
which Europe is engaged&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem width24">
<div class="stanza">
<p><span style="margin-left:-1em;">"What is it all but a trouble of ants</span></p>
<p>in the gleam of a million million of suns?"</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Yet, for true interpretation, the infinite worth and
vital importance of each individual human soul must be
apprehended too. And that is another momentous fact,
which, so far from restricting the potentialities of existence,
by implication still further enlarges them. The
multiplicity, the many-sidedness, the magnificence, of
material existence does not dwarf the human soul; far
otherwise: it illumines and expands the stage upon which
the human drama is being played, and ought to make us
ready to perceive how far greater still may be the possibilities&mdash;nay,
the actualities&mdash;before it, in its infinite
unending progress.</p>

<p>That we know little about such possibilities as yet,
proves nothing;&mdash;for mark how easy it would have been
to be ignorant of the existence of all the visible worlds and
myriad modes of being in space. Not until the business of
the day is over, and our great star has eclipsed itself behind
the earth, not until the serener period of night, does the
grandeur of the material universe force itself upon our
attention. And, even then, let there be but a slight
permanent thickening of our atmosphere, and we should
have had no revelation of any world other than our own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[ 310]</a></span>
Under those conditions&mdash;so barely escaped from&mdash;how
wretchedly meagre and limited would have been our conception
of the Universe! Aye, and, unless we foolishly
imagine that our circumstances are such as to have already
given us a clue to every kind of possible existence, I
venture to say that "wretchedly meagre and limited"
must be a true description of our conception of the Universe,
even now,&mdash;even of the conception of those who
have permitted themselves, with least hesitation, to follow
whithersoever facts lead.</p>

<p>If there be any group of scientific or historical or
literary students who advocate what they think to be a
sensible, but what I regard as a purblind, view of existence,
based upon already systematised knowledge and on unfounded
and restricting speculation as to probable boundaries
and limitations of existence,&mdash;if such students take
their own horizon to be the measure of all things,&mdash;the fact
is to be deplored. Such workers, however admirable
their industry and detailed achievements, represent a
school of thought against the fruits of which we of the
Allied Nations are in arms.</p>

<p>Nevertheless speculation of this illegitimate and negative
kind is not unknown among us. It originates partly
in admiration for the successful labours of a bygone generation
in clearing away a quantity of clinging parasitic
growth which was obscuring the fair fabric of ascertained
truth, and partly in an innate iconoclastic enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The success which has attended Darwinian and other
hypotheses has had a tendency to lead men&mdash;not indeed
men of Darwinian calibre, but smaller and less conscientious
men&mdash;in science as well as in history and theology,
to an over-eager confidence in probable conjecture and
inadequate attention to facts of experience. It has even
been said&mdash;I quote from a writer in the volume <i>Darwin
and Modern Science</i>, published in connexion with a
Darwin jubilee celebration at Cambridge&mdash;that "the age
of materialism was the least matter-of-fact age conceivable,
and the age of science the age which showed least
of the patient temper of enquiry." I would not go so far
as this myself, the statement savours of exaggeration, but
there is a regrettable tendency in surviving materialistic
quarters for combatants to entrench themselves in dogma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[ 311]</a></span>
and preconceived opinion, to regard these vulnerable
shelters as sufficient protection against observed and recorded
facts, and even to employ them as strongholds
from which alien observation-posts can be shattered and
overthrown.</p>

<span class="small">PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE</span>
</h2>
</div>

<p>"How often have men thus feared that Nature's wonders
would be degraded by being closelier looked into! How often,
again, have they learnt that the truth was higher than their imagination;
and that it is man's work, but never Nature's, which
to be magnificent must remain unknown!"&mdash;F. W. H. M., Introduction
to <i>Phantasms of the Living</i>
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">OUR actual experience is strangely limited. We
cannot be actually conscious of more than a single
instant of time. The momentary flash which we call
the present, the visual image of which can be made permanent
by the snap of a camera, is all of the external
world that we directly apprehended. But our real existence
embraces far more than that. The present, alone and
isolated, would be meaningless to us; we look before and
after. Our memories are thronged with the past; our
anticipations range over the future; and it is in the past
and the future that we really live. It is so even with the
higher animals: they too order their lives by memory
and anticipation. It is under the influence of the future
that the animal world performs even the most trivial
conscious acts. We eat, we rest, we work, all with an eye
to the immediate future. The present moment is illuminated
and made significant, is controlled and dominated,
by experience of the past and by expectation of the future.
Without any idea of the future our existence would be
purely mechanical and meaningless: with too little eye to
the future&mdash;a mere living from hand to mouth&mdash;it becomes
monotonous and dull.</p>

<p>Hence it is right that humanity, transcending merely
animal scope, should seek to answer questions concerning
its origin and destiny, and should regard with intense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[ 313]</a></span>
interest every clue to the problems of 'whence' and
'whither.'</p>

<p>It is no doubt possible, as always, to overstep the
happy mean, and by absorption in and premature concern
with future interests to lose the benefit and the training of
this present life. But although we may rightly decide to
live with full vigour in the present, and do our duty from
moment to moment, yet in order to be full-flavoured and
really intelligent beings&mdash;not merely with mechanical
drift following the line of least resistance&mdash;we ought to be
aware that there is a future,&mdash;a future determined to some
extent by action in the present; and it is only reasonable
that we should seek to ascertain, roughly and approximately,
what sort of future it is likely to be.</p>

<p>Inquiry into survival, and into the kind of experience
through which we shall all certainly have to go in a few
years, is therefore eminently sane, and may be vitally
significant. It may colour all our actions, and give a
vivid meaning both to human history and to personal
experience.</p>

<p>If death is not extinction, then on the other side of
dissolution mental activity must continue, and must be
interacting with other mental activity. For the fact of
telepathy proves that bodily organs are not absolutely
essential to communication of ideas. Mind turns out to
be able to act directly on mind, and stimulate it into
response by other than material means. Thought does not
belong to the material region: although it is able to exert
an influence on that region through mechanism provided
by vitality. Yet the means whereby it accomplishes the
feat are essentially unknown, and the fact that such interaction
is possible would be strange and surprising if we
were not too much accustomed to it. It is reasonable to
suppose that the mind can be more at home, and more
directly and more exuberantly active, where the need
for such interaction between psychical and physical&mdash;or
let us more safely and specifically say between mental
and material&mdash;no longer exists, when the restraining
influence of brain and nerve mechanism is removed, and
when some of the limitations connected with bodily location
in space are ended.</p>

<p>Experience must be our guide. To shut the door on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[ 314]</a></span>
actual observation and experiment in this particular
region, because of preconceived ideas and obstinate prejudices,
is an attitude common enough, even among
scientific men; but it is an attitude markedly unscientific.
Certain people have decided that inquiry into the
activities of discarnate mind is futile; some few consider
it impious; many, perhaps wisely mistrusting their own
powers, shrink from entering on such an inquiry. But
if there are any facts to be ascertained, it must be the duty
of some volunteers to try to ascertain them: and for
people having any acquaintance with scientific history to
shut their eyes to facts when definitely announced, and
to forbid investigation or report concerning them on pain
of ostracism,&mdash;is to imitate a bygone theological attitude
in a spirit of unintended flattery&mdash;a flattery which from
every point of view is eccentric; and likewise to display
an extraordinary lack of humour.
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">On the Possibility of Prognostication</span></h3>

<p>I do not wish to complicate the issue at present by
introducing the idea of prognostication or prevision, for
I do not understand how anticipation of the future is
possible. It is only known to be possible by one of two
processes&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:3em;">(<i>a</i>) Inference&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> deduction from a wide knowledge
of the present;</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left:3em;">(<i>b</i>) Planning&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the carrying out of a prearranged
scheme.</span></p>

<p>And these methods must be pressed to the utmost before
admitting any other hypothesis.</p>

<p>As to the possibility of prevision in general, I do not
dogmatise, nor have I a theory wherewith to explain every
instance; but I keep an open mind and try to collate
and contemplate the facts.</p>

<p>Scientific prediction is familiar enough; science is
always either historic or prophetic (as Dr. Schuster said at
Manchester in the British Association Address for 1915),
"and history is only prophecy pursued in the negative
direction." This thesis is worth illustrating:&mdash;That
Eclipses can be calculated forwards or backwards is well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[ 315]</a></span>
known. A tide-calculating machine, again, which is used
to churn out tidal detail in advance by turning a handle,
could be as easily run backwards and give past tides if
they were wanted; but always on the assumption that
no catastrophe, no unforeseen contingency, nothing outside
the limits of the data, occurs to interfere with the
placid course of phenomena. There must be no dredging
or harbour bar operations, for instance, if the tide machine
is to be depended on. Free-will is not allowed for, in
Astronomy or Physics; nor any interference by living
agents.</p>

<p>The real truth is that, except for unforeseen contingencies,
past, present, and future are welded together in a
coherent whole; and to a mind with wider purview, to
whom perhaps hardly anything is unforeseen, there may
be possibilities of inference to an unsuspected extent.
Human character, and action based upon it, may be more
trustworthy and uncapricious than is usually supposed;
and data depending on humanity may be included in a
completer scheme of foreknowledge, without the exercise
of any compulsion. "The past," says Bertrand Russell
eloquently, "does not change or strive; like Duncan,
after life's fitful fever it sleeps well; what was eager and
grasping, what was petty and transitory, has faded away;
the things that were beautiful and eternal shine out of it

to attempt to compose a similar or rather a contrasting
sentence about the future.

<h3><span class="smcap">Reference to Special Cases</span></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>It will be observed that none of those indications or intimations
or intuitions which are referred to in a note on page 34, Part
I, if they mean anything, raise the difficult question of prevision.
In every case the impression was felt after or at the time of the
event, though before reception of the news. The only question
of possible prevision in the present instance arises in connexion
with the 'Faunus' message quoted and discussed in Part II. But
even here nothing more than kindly provision, in case anything
untoward should happen, need be definitely assumed. Moreover,
if the concurrence in time suggests prognostication, the fact that
a formidable attempt to advance the English Front at the Ypres
salient was probably in prospect in August 1915, though not
known to ordinary people in England, and not fully carried out
till well on in September, must have been within human knowledge;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[ 316]</a></span>
and so would have to be considered telepathically accessible, if that
hypothesis is considered preferable to the admission of what Tennyson
speaks of as&mdash;</p>

<p>Prognostication can hardly be part of the evidence for survival.
The two things are not essential to each other; they hardly
appear to be connected. But one knows too little about the whole
thing to be sure even of this, and I decline to take the responsibility
for suppressing any of the facts. I know that Mr. Myers
used to express an opinion that certain kinds of prevision would
constitute clear and satisfactory evidence of something supernormal,
and so attract attention; though the establishment of such
a possibility might tend to suggest a kind of higher knowledge,
not far short of what might be popularly called omniscience, rather
than of merely human survival.</p>

<span class="small">INTERACTION OF MIND AND MATTER</span></h2>

<p class="center">"Spiritus intus alit, totamque infusa per artus<br />
Mens agitat molem, et magno se corpore miscet."</p>
<p><span style="margin-left:30em;"><i>�neid</i>, vi. 726</span>
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">LIFE and mind and consciousness do not belong to
the material region; whatever they are in themselves,
they are manifestly something quite distinct
from matter and energy, and yet they utilise the
material and dominate it.</p>

<p>Matter is arranged and moved by means of energy,
but often at the behest of life and mind. Mind does not
itself exert force, nor does it enter into the scheme of
physics, and yet it indirectly brings about results which
otherwise would not have happened. It definitely causes
movements and arrangements or constructions of a purposed
character. A bird grows a feather, and a bird
builds a nest: I doubt if there is less design in the one
case than in the other. How life achieves the guidance,
how even it accomplishes the movements, is a mystery,
but that it does accomplish them is a commonplace of
observation. From the motion of a finger to the construction
of an aeroplane, there is but a succession of
steps. From the growth of a weed to the flight of an
eagle,&mdash;from a yeast granule at one end, to the human
body at the other,&mdash;the organising power of life over
matter is conspicuous.</p>

<p>Who can doubt the supremacy of the spiritual over
the material? It is a fact which, illustrated by trivial
instances, may be pressed to the most portentous consequences.</p>

<p>If interaction between mind and matter really occurs,
and if both are persistent and enduring entities, there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[ 318]</a></span>
limit to the possibilities under which such interaction may
occur&mdash;no limit which can be laid down beforehand&mdash;we
must be guided and instructed solely by experience.</p>

<p>Whether the results produced are styled miraculous
or not, depends on our knowledge,&mdash;our knowledge of all
the powers latent in nature, and a knowledge of all the
intelligences which exist. A savage on his first encounter
with white men must have come into contact with what
to him was supernatural. A letter, a gun, even artificial
teeth, have all aroused superstition; while a telegram
must be obviously miraculous, to anyone intelligent enough
to perceive the wonder. A colony of bees, unused to the
ministrations or interference of man, might puzzle itself
over the provision made for its habitation and activities,
if it had intelligence enough to ponder the matter. So
human beings, if they are open-minded and developed
enough to contemplate all the happenings in which they
are concerned, have been led to recognise guidance;
and they have responded to the perception by the worshipful
attitude of religion. In other words, they have
essentially recognised the existence of a Power transcending
ordinary nature&mdash;a Power that may properly be
called supernatural.
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Meaning of the Term Body</span></h3>

<p>Our experience of bodies here and now is that they are
composed of material particles derived from the earth,
whether they be bodies animated by vegetable or by
animal forms of life. But I take it that the real meaning
of the term 'body' is a <i>means of manifestation</i>,&mdash;perhaps
a physical mode of manifestation adopted by something
which without such instrument or organ would be in a
different and elusive category. Why should we say that
bodies must be made of matter? Surely only because
we know of nothing else of which they could be made;
but that lack of knowledge is not very efficient as an argument.
True, if they were made of anything else they
would not be apparent to us now, with our particular
evolutionally-derived sense organs; for these only inform
us about matter and its properties. Constructions built
of Ether would have no chance of appealing to our senses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[ 319]</a></span>
they would not be apparent to us; they would therefore
not be what we ordinarily call bodies; at any rate they
would not be material bodies. In order to become apparent
to us, a psychical or vital entity must enter the
material realm, and either clothe itself with, or temporarily
assimilate, material particles.</p>

<p>It may be that etherial bodies do not exist; the
burden of proof rests upon those who conceive of their
possible existence; but we are bound to admit that even
if they did exist, they would make no impression on our
senses. Hence if there are any intelligences in another
order of existence interlocked with ours, and if they can
in any sense be supposed to have bodies at all, those
bodies must be made either of Ether or of something
equally intangible to us in our present condition.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Yet, though intangible and elusive, we have reason to
know that Ether is substantial enough,&mdash;far more substantial
indeed than matter, which turns out to be a rare
and filmy insertion in, or modification of, the Ether of
Space; and a different set of sense organs might make
the Ether eclipse matter in availability and usefulness.
In my book <i>The Ether of Space</i> this thesis is elaborated
from a purely physical point of view.</p>

<p>I wish, however, to make no assertion concerning the
possible psychical use of the Ether of Space. Anything
of that kind must be speculative; the only bodies we
now know of in actual fact are material bodies, and we
must be guided by facts. Yet we must not shut the door
prematurely on other possibilities; and we can remember
that inspired writers have sometimes contemplated what
they term a spiritual body.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[ 320]</a></span></p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Permanence of Body</span></h3>

<p>But why should anyone suppose a body of some kind
always necessary? Why should they assume a perpetual
sort of dualism about existence? The reason is that we
have no knowledge of any other form of animate existence;
and it may be claimed as legitimate to assume that
the association between life and matter here on the planet
has a real and vital significance, that without such an
episode of earth life we should be less than we are,
and that the relation is typical of something real and
permanent.</p>

<p class="center">
"Such use may lie in blood and breath."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tennyson</span>
</p>

<p><i>Why</i> matter should be thus useful to spirit and even
to life it is not easy to say. It may be that by the interaction
of two things better and newer results can always
be obtained than was possible for one alone. There are
analogies enough for that. Do we not find that genius
seems to require the obstruction or the aid of matter for
its full development? The artist must enjoy being able
to compel refractory material to express his meaning.
Didactic writings are apt to emphasise the obstructiveness
of matter; but that may be because its usefulness
seems self-evident. Our limbs, and senses, and bodily
faculties generally, are surely of momentous service;
microscopes and telescopes and laboratory instruments,
and machinery generally, are only extensions of them.
Tools to the man who can use them:&mdash;orchestra to the
musician, lathe or theodolite to the engineer, books and
records to the historian, even though not much more
than pen and paper is needed by the poet or the mathematician.</p>

<p>But our bodily organs are much more than any
artificial tools can be, they are part of our very being.
The body is part of the constitution of man. We are not
spirit or soul alone,&mdash;though it is sometimes necessary to
emphasise the fact that we are soul at all,&mdash;we are in
truth soul and body together. And so I think we shall
always be; though our bodies need not always be composed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[ 321]</a></span>
of earthly particles. Matter is the accidental part:
there is an essential and more permanent part, and the
permanent part must survive.</p>

<p>This is the strength, as I have said elsewhere and will
not now at any length repeat, of the sacramental claims
and practices of religion. Forms and customs which
appeal to the body are a legitimate part of the whole;
and while some natures derive most benefit from the
exclusively psychical and spiritual essence, others probably
do well to prevent the more sensuous and more
puzzling concomitants from falling into disuse.</p>

It may be said that what is intangible ought to be invisible; but that does
not follow. The Ether is a medium for vision, not for touch. Ether and
Ether may interact, just as matter and matter interact; but interaction
between Ether and matter is peculiarly elusive.</p>

<span style="margin-left:30em;"><span class="smcap">Edwin Arnold</span></span>
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the whole unknown drama of the soul the episode
of bodily existence must have profound significance.
Matter cannot only be obstructive, even usefully
obstructive,&mdash;by which is meant the kind of obstruction
which stimulates to effort and trains for power, like the
hurdles in an obstacle race,&mdash;it must be auxiliary too.
Whatever may be the case with external matter, the body
itself is certainly an auxiliary, so long as it is in health and
strength; and it gives opportunity for the development of
the soul in new and unexpected ways&mdash;ways in which but
for earth life its practice would be deficient. This it is
which makes calamity of too short a life.</p>

<p>But let us not be over-despondent about the tragedy
of the present. It may be that the concentrated training
and courageous facing of fate which in most cases must
have accompanied voluntary entry into a dangerous war,
compensates in intensity what it lacks in duration, and
that the benefit of bodily terrestrial life is not so much
lost by violent death of that kind as might at first appear.
Yet even with some such assurance, the spectacle of
thousands of youths in full vigour and joy of life having
their earthly future violently wrenched from them, amid
scenes of grim horror and nerve-wracking noise and confusion,
is one which cannot and ought not to be regarded
with equanimity. It is a bad and unnatural truncation of
an important part of each individual career, a part which
might have done much to develop faculties and enlarge
experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[ 323]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the very fact that we lament so sincerely
this dire and man-caused fate serves to illustrate the view
we inevitably take that the earth-body is not only a means
of manifestation but is a real servant of the soul,&mdash;that
flesh can in some sense help spirit as spirit can undoubtedly
help flesh,&mdash;and that while its very weaknesses are serviceable
and stimulating, its strength is exhilarating and
superb. The faculties and powers developed in the animal
kingdom during all the millions of years of evolution, and
now inherited for better for worse by man, are not to be
despised. Those therefore who are able to think that
some of the essential elements or attributes of the body
are carried forward into a higher life&mdash;quite irrespective of
the manifestly discarded material particles which never
were important to the body, for they were always in perpetual
flux as individual molecules&mdash;those, I say, who
think that the value derived and acquired through the
body survives, and becomes a permanent possession of the
soul, may well feel that they can employ the medi�val
phrase "resurrection of the body" to express their perception.
They may feel that it is a truth which needs
emphasising all the more from its lack of obviousness.
These old phrases, consecrated by long usage, and familiar
to all the saints, though their early and superficial meaning
is evidently superseded, may be found to have an inner
and spiritual significance which when once grasped should
be kept in memory, and brought before attention, and
sustained against challenge: in no case should they be
lightly or hastily discarded.</p>

<p>It seems not altogether fanciful to trace some similarity
or analogy, between the ideas about inheritance usually
associated with the name of Weismann, and the inheritance
or conveyance of bodily attributes, or of powers
acquired through the body, into the future life of the soul.</p>

<p>When considering whether anything, or what, is likely
to be permanent, the answer turns upon whether or not
the soul has been affected. Mere bodily accidents of
course are temporary; loss of an arm or an eye is no more
carried on as a permanent disfigurement than it is transmissible
to offspring. But, apart from accidents which
may happen to the body, there are some evil things&mdash;rendered
accessible by and definitely associated with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[ 324]</a></span>
body&mdash;which assault and hurt the soul. And the effect
of these is transmissible, and may become permanent.
Habits which write their mark on the countenance&mdash;whether
the writing be good or bad&mdash;are not likely to take
effect on the body alone. And in this sense also future
existence may be either glorified or stained, for a time, by
persistence of bodily traits,&mdash;by this kind of "resurrection
of the body."</p>

<p>Furthermore it is found that although bodily marks,
scars and wounds, are clearly not of soul-compelling and
permanent character, yet for purposes of identification,
and when re-entering the physical atmosphere for the
purpose of communication with friends, these temporary
marks are re-assumed; just as the general appearance at
the remembered age, and details connected with clothes
and little unessential tricks of manner, may&mdash;in some unknown
sense&mdash;be assumed too.</p>

<p>And it is to this category that I would attribute the
curious interest still felt in old personal possessions. They
are attended to and recalled, not for what by a shopman
is called their 'value,' but because they furnish useful and
welcome evidence of identity; they are like the <i>pi�ces de
conviction</i> brought up at a trial, they bear silent witness
to remembered fact. And in so far as the disposal or
treatment of them by survivors is evidence of the regard
in which their late owner was held, it is unlikely that they
should have suddenly become matters of complete indifference.
Nothing human, in the sense of affecting the
human spirit, can be considered foreign to a friendly and
sympathetic soul, even though his new preoccupations and
industries and main activities are of a different order. It
appears as if, for the few moments of renewed earthly
intercourse, the newer surroundings shrink for a time into
the background. They are remembered, but not vividly.
Indeed it seems difficult to live in both worlds at once,
especially after the life-long practice here of living almost
exclusively in one. Those whose existence here was
coloured or ennobled by wider knowledge and higher aims
seem likely to have the best chance of conveying instructive
information across the boundary; though their developed
powers may be of such still higher value, that only
from a sense of duty or in a missionary spirit can they be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[ 325]</a></span>
expected to absent them from felicity while in order to
help the brethren.</p>

<p>Quotation of a passage from Plotinus seems here permissible:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Souls which once were in men, when they leave the
body, need not cease from benefiting mankind. Some
indeed, in addition to other services, give occult messages
(oracular replies), thus proving by their own case that
other souls also survive" (<i>Enn.</i> <span class="smcap">IV</span>. vii. 15).</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>As a digression of some importance, I venture to say
that claims of thoughtless and pertinacious people upon
the charitable and eminent, even here, are often excessive:
it is to be hoped that such claims become less troublesome
and less effective hereafter; but it is a hope without much
foundation. Remonstrances are useless, however, for
only the more thoughtful and those most deserving of
help are likely to attend to remonstrances. Nevertheless&mdash;useless
or not&mdash;it behoves one to make them. We are
indeed taught that in exceptional cases there may ultimately
supervene such an extraordinary elevation of soul
that no trouble is too great, and no appeal is unheard. But
still, even in the Loftiest case of all, the episode of having
passed through a human body contributes to the power of
sympathising with and aiding ordinary humanity.</p>

<p class="center">
"For nothing is that errs from law."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tennyson</span>
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">It is sometimes thought that memory is located in
the brain; and undoubtedly there must be some
physiological process at work in the brain when any
incident of memory is recalled and either uttered or
written. But it does not at all follow that memory itself
is located in the brain; though there must be some easier
channel, or some already prepared path, which enables
an idea to be translated from the general mental reservoir
into consciousness, with clarity and power sufficient
to stimulate the necessary nerves and muscles into a condition
adequate for reproduction.</p>

<p>Sometimes in order to remember a thing, one writes it
in a note-book; and the memory may be said to be in the
note-book about as accurately as it may be said to be in
the brain. A physical process has put it in the note-book;
there is a physical configuration persisting there;
and when a sort of reverse physical process is repeated, it
can be got back into consciousness by simply what we
call 'looking' at the book and reading. But surely the
real memory is in the <i>mind</i> all the time, and the deposit in
the note-book is a mere detent for calling it out or for
making it easy of recovery. In order to communicate
any information we must focus attention on it; and
whether we focus attention on a part of the brain or on a
page of a note-book matters very little; the attention
itself is a mental process, not a physiological one, though
it has a physiological concomitant.</p>

<p>This is an important matter, the keystone in fact of
our problem about the connexion between mind and
matter, and I propose to amplify its treatment further;
for this is an unavoidably controversial portion of the
book.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[ 327]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Seat of Memory</span></h3>

<p>I am familiar with all the usual analogies drawn
between organic habit and memory on the one hand,
and the more ready repetition of physical processes
by inorganic material on the other. Imperfectly elastic
springs, for instance, which show reminiscences of previous
bendings or twistings by their subsequent unwindings;
and cogs which wear into smooth running by repetition;
are examples of this kind. A violin which by long
practice becomes more musical in tone, is another; or
a path which by being often traversed becomes easier to
the feet. A flower-bed recently altered in shape, by
being partly grassed over, is liable to exhibit its former
outline by aid of bulbs and other half-forgotten growths
which come up through the grass in the old pattern.</p>

<p>This last is a striking example of apparent memory,
not indeed in the inorganic but in the unconscious world;
where indeed it is prevalent, for every one must recognise
the memory of animals&mdash;there can be no doubt of that.
And it would seem that a kind of race-memory must be
invoked to account for many surprising cases of instinct;
of which the building of specific birds' nests, and the
accurate pecking of a newly-hatched chicken, are among
the stock instances. No experience can be lodged in the
<i>brain</i> of the newly-hatched!</p>

<p>That some sort of stored facility should exist in the
adult brain, is in no way surprising; and that there is some
physical or physiological concomitant of actual remembrance
is plain; but that is a very different thing from
asserting that memory itself, or any kind of consciousness,
is located in the brain; though truly without the aid of
the brain it is, as far as this planet is concerned, latent and
inaccessible.</p>

<p>Plotinus puts the matter in an interesting but perhaps
rather too extreme form:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"As to memory, the body is an impediment ... the
unstable and fluctuating nature of the body makes for
oblivion not for memory. Body is a veritable River of
Lethe. Memory belongs to the soul" (<i>Enn.</i> <span class="smcap">IV</span>. iii. 26).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The actual reproduction or remembrance of a fact&mdash;the
demonstration or realisation of memory&mdash;undoubtedly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[ 328]</a></span>
depends on brain and muscle mechanism; but memory
itself turns out to be essentially mental, and is found
to exist apart from the bodily mechanism which helped
originally to receive and store the impression. And
though without that same or some equivalent mechanism
we cannot get at it, so that it cannot be displayed to
others, yet in my experience it turns out not to be absolutely
necessary to use actually the same instrument for
its reproduction as was responsible for its deposition:
though undoubtedly to use the same is easier and helpful.
In the early Edison phonographs the same instrument had
to be used for both reception and reproduction; but now
a record can readily be transferred from one instrument
to another. This may be regarded as a rough mechanical
analogy to the telepathic or telergic process whereby a
psychic reservoir of memory can be partially tapped
through another organism.</p>

<p>But, apart from any consideration of what may be
regarded as doubtful or uncertain, there are some facts
about the relation of brain to consciousness, which,
though universally admitted, are frequently misinterpreted.
Injure the brain, and consciousness is lost.
'Lost' is the right word&mdash;not 'destroyed.' Repair the
lesion, and consciousness may be restored, i.e. normal
manifestation of consciousness can once more occur. It
is the <i>display</i> of consciousness, in all such cases, that we
mean when we speak of the effect of brain injury; the
utilisation of bodily organs is necessary for its exhibition.
If the bodily organs do not exist, or are too damaged, no
normal manifestation is possible. That is the fact which
may be misinterpreted.</p>

<p>In general we may say, with fair security, that no
receptivity to physical phenomena exists save through
sense-organ, nerve, and brain; nor any initiation of
physical phenomena, save through brain, nerve, and
muscle. Apart from physical phenomena consciousness
is isolated and inaccessible: we have no right to say that
it is non-existent. In ordinary usage it is not customary
or necessary to be always harping on this completer
aspect of things: it is only necessary when misunderstanding
has arisen from uniformly inaccurate, or rather
unguarded, modes of expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[ 329]</a></span></p>

<p>In an excellent lecture by Dr. Mott on "The Effects of
High Explosives upon the Central Nervous System," I
find this sentence:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is known that a continuous supply of oxygen is
essential for consciousness."</p>

<p>What is intended is clear enough, but analysed strictly
this assertion goes far beyond what is known. We do not
really know that oxygen, or any form of matter, has anything
to do with consciousness: all that we know, and all
that Dr. Mott really means to say, I presume, is that
without a supply of oxygen consciousness gives no physical
sign.</p>

<p>Partial interruptions of physical manifestations of consciousness
well illustrate this: as, for instance, when speech-centres
of the brain alone are affected. If in such case we
had to depend on mouth-muscle alone we should say that
consciousness had departed, and might even think that it
was non-existent; but the arm-muscle may remain under
brain control, and by intelligent writing can show that
consciousness is there all the time, and that it is only
inhibited from one of the specially easy modes of manifestation.
In some cases the inhibition may be complete,&mdash;from
such cases we do not learn much; but when it is
only partial we learn a good deal.</p>

<p>I quote again from Dr. Mott, omitting for brevity the
detailed description of certain surgical war-cases, under
his care, which precedes the following explanatory interjection
and summary:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Why should these men, whose silent thoughts are
perfect, be unable to speak? They comprehend all that
is said to them unless they are deaf; but it is quite clear
that [even] in these cases their internal language is unaffected,
for they are able to express their thoughts and
judgments perfectly well by writing, even if they are deaf.
The mutism is therefore not due to an intellectual defect,
nor is it due to volitional inhibition of language in silent
thought. Hearing, the primary incitation to vocalisation
and speech, is usually unaffected, yet they are unable to
speak; they cannot even whisper, cough, whistle, or laugh
aloud. Many who are unable to speak voluntarily yet call
out in their dreams expressions they have used in trench
warfare and battle. Sometimes this is followed by return
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[ 330]</a></span>
of speech, but more often not. One man continually
shouted out in his sleep, but he did not recover voluntary
speech or power of phonation till eight months after admission
to the hospital for shell-shock."</p>

<p>Very well, all this interesting experience serves among
other things to illustrate our simple but occasionally overlooked
thesis. For it is through physical phenomena that
normally we apprehend, here and now; and it is by aid of
physical phenomena that we convey to others our wishes,
our impressions, our ideas, and our memories. Dislocate
the physical from the psychical, and communication
ceases. Restore the connexion, in however imperfect a
form, and once more incipient communication may become
possible again.</p>

<p>That is the rationale of the process of human intercourse.
Do we understand it? No. Do we understand
even how our own mind operates on our own body? No.
We know for a fact that it does.</p>

<p>Do we understand how a mind can with difficulty and
imperfectly operate another body submitted to its temporary
guidance and control? No. Do we know for a
fact that it does? Aye, that is the question&mdash;a question
of evidence. I myself answer the question affirmatively;
not on theoretical grounds&mdash;far from that&mdash;but on a basis
of straightforward experience. Others, if they allow themselves
to take the trouble to get the experience, will come
to the same conclusion.</p>

<p>Will they do so best by allowing their own bodies or
brains to be utilised? No, that seems not even the best,
and certainly not the only way. It may not, for the
majority of people, be a possible way. The sensitive or
medium who serves us, by putting his or her bodily
mechanism at our disposal, is not likely to be best informed
concerning the nature of the process. Mediums have
perhaps but little conscious information to give us concerning
their powers; we must learn from what they do, not
from what they say. The outside observer, the experimenter,
whose senses are alert all the time and who
continues fully conscious without special receptivity or
any peculiar power of his own, is in a better position to
note and judge what is happening,&mdash;at least from the
normal and scientific point of view. Let us be as cautious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[ 331]</a></span>
and critical, aye and as sceptical as we like, but let us also
be patient and persevering and fair; do not let us start
with a preconceived notion of what is possible and what is
impossible in this almost unexplored universe; let us only
be willing to learn and be guided by facts, not by dogmas;
and gradually the truth will permeate our understanding
and make for itself a place in our minds as secure as in
any other branch of observational science.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">The limitation of scope which eminent Professors
of a certain school of modern science have laid
down for themselves is forcibly expressed by one
of the ablest of their champions thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"No sane man has ever pretended, since science became
a definite body of doctrine, that we know or ever can hope
to know or conceive the possibility of knowing whence the
mechanism has come, why it is there, whither it is going, or
what may be beyond and beside it which our senses are
incapable of appreciating. These things are not 'explained'
by science and never can be."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir E. Ray Lankester.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I should myself hesitate to promulgate such a markedly
<i>non-possumus</i> and <i>ignorabimus</i> statement concerning the
scope of physical science, even as narrowly and popularly
understood; but it illuminates the position taken up
by those <i>savants</i> who are commonly known as Materialists,
and explains their expressed though non-personal hostility
to other scientific men who seek to exceed the boundaries
laid down, and investigate things beyond the immediate
range of the senses.</p>

<p>Eliminating the future tense from the statement,
however, I can agree with it. The instrument of translation
from the mental to the physical, and back from
the physical to the mental, is undoubtedly the brain,
but as to how the translation is accomplished, I venture
to say, we have not the inkling of an idea. Nevertheless,
hints which may gradually lead towards a partial understanding
of psycho-physical processes may be gained by
study of exceptional cases: for such study is often more
instructive than continued scrutiny of the merely normal.</p>

<p>The fact of human consciousness, though it raises the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[ 333]</a></span>
problem to a high degree of conspicuousness, by no means
exhausts the difficulty; for it is one which faces us in
connexion with every form of life. The association of
life with matter, and of mind with life, are problems of
similar order, and a glimmering of understanding of the
one may be expected to throw light upon the other. But
until we know more of the method by which the simplest
and most familiar psycho-physical interaction occurs&mdash;until
we know enough to see how the gulf between
two apparently different Modes of Being is bridged&mdash;it
is safest to observe and accumulate facts, and to be
very chary of making more than the most tentative and
cautious of working hypotheses. For to frame even a
tentative hypothesis, of any helpful kind, may require
some clue which as yet we do not possess.</p>

<p>I have been struck by the position taken by Dr.
Chalmers Mitchell in his notable small book <i>Evolution
and the War</i>, the early chapters of which, on Germany
of the past and present, I would like unreservedly to
commend to the reader. Indeed, commendation of a
friendly and non-patronising kind may well extend to the
whole book, although it must be admitted that here and
there mere exposition of Darwinism is suspended, and
difficult and debatable questions are touched upon.</p>

<p>On these questions I would not like to be understood
as expressing a hasty opinion, either against or for the
views of the author. The points at issue between us are
more or less fine-drawn, and cannot be dealt with parenthetically;
nor do I ever propose to deal with them in a
controversial manner. The author, as a biologist of fame,
is more than entitled to such expression of his own views
as he has cared to give. I quote with admiration, not
necessarily with agreement, a few passages from the part
dealing with the relation between mind and matter, and
especially with the wide and revolutionary difference
between man and animal caused by either the evolution
or the incoming of free and conscious Choice.</p>

<p>He will not allow, with Bergson and others, that the
roots of consciousness, in its lower grades, go deep down
into the animal, and even perhaps into the vegetable,
kingdom; he has no patience with those who associate
elementary consciousness and freedom and indeterminateness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[ 334]</a></span>
not merely with human life but with all life, and who
detect rudiments of purpose and intelligence in the
protozoa. Nor, on the other hand, does he approve the
dogmatic teaching of the 'ultra-scientific' school, which,
being obsessed by the idea of man's animal origin, interprets
human nature solely in terms of protoplasm. He
opposes the possibility of this by saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"However fruitful and interesting it may be to remember
that we are rooted deep in the natal mud, our
possession of consciousness and the sense of freedom is a
vital and overmastering distinction."</p>

<p>On the more interesting of the above-mentioned alternatives
Dr. Chalmers Mitchell expresses himself thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Bergsonian interpretation does nothing to make
consciousness and freedom more intelligible; and by
extending them from man, in whom we know them to
exist, to animals, in which their presence is at best an
inference, it not only robs them of definiteness and reality,
but it blurs the real distinction between men and animals,
and evades the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
The facts are more truly represented by such
phraseology as that animals are instinctive, man is intelligent,
animals are irresponsible, man is responsible,
animals are automata, man is free; or if you like, that
God gave animals a beautiful body, man a rational
soul...."</p>

<p>And soon afterwards he continues:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not 'envisaging itself,' not being at once actor,
spectator, and critic, 'living in the flashing moment,' not
seeing the past and the present and the future separately,
this is the highest at which we can put the consciousness
of animals, and herein lies the distinction between man
and the animals which makes the overwhelming difference.</p>

<p>"Must we then suppose, with Russel Wallace, that
somewhere on the upward path from the tropical forests
to the groves of Paradise, a soul was interpolated from an
outside source into the gorilla-like ancestry of man? I
do not think so, although I not only admit but assert
that such a view gives a more accurate statement of fact
than does either of the fashionable doctrines that I have
discussed. I believe with Darwin, that as the body of
man has been evolved from the body of animals, so the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[ 335]</a></span>
intellectual, emotional, and moral faculties of man have
been evolved from the qualities of animals. I help myself
towards the comprehension of the process by reflecting
on two phenomena of observation [which he proceeds to
cite]. I help myself, and perchance may help others;
no more; could I speak dogmatically on what is the central
mystery of all science and all philosophy and all thought,
my words would roll with the thunder of Sinai."</p>

<p>Let it not be supposed for a moment that this distinguished
biologist is in agreement with me on many
matters dealt with in the present book. If he were, he
would, I believe, achieve a more admirable and eloquent
work than is consistent with the technically 'apologetic'
tone which, in the present state of the scientific atmosphere,
it behoves me to take. To guard against unwelcome
misrepresentation of his views, and yet at the same time
to indicate their force, I will make one more quotation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Writing as a hard-shell Darwinian evolutionist, a lover of
the scalpel and microscope, and of patient, empirical observation,
as one who dislikes all forms of supernaturalism, and who
does not shrink from the implications even of the phrase that
thought is a secretion of the brain as bile is a secretion of the
liver, I assert as a biological fact that the moral law is as real
and as external to man as the starry vault. It has no secure
seat in any single man or in any single nation. It is the work
of the blood and tears of long generations of men. It is not, in
man, inborn or innate, but is enshrined in his traditions, in his
customs, in his literature and his religion. Its creation and
sustenance are the crowning glory of man, and his consciousness
of it puts him in a high place above the animal world. Men live
and die; nations rise and fall, but the struggle of individual
lives and of individual nations must be measured not by their
immediate needs, but as they tend to the debasement or perfection
of man's great achievement."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My own view, which in such matters I only put forth
with diffidence and brevity, is more in favour of Continuity.
I do not trace so catastrophic a break between
man and animals, nor between animal and vegetable,
perhaps not even between organised and unorganised
forms of matter, as does Dr. Chalmers Mitchell.</p>

<p>I would venture to extend the range of the term
'soul' down to a very large denominator,&mdash;to cases in
which the magnitude of the fraction becomes excessively
minute,&mdash;and tentatively admit to the possibility of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[ 336]</a></span>
survival, though not individual survival, every form of
life. As to Individuality and Personality&mdash;they can only
survive where they already exist; when they really
exist they persist; but bare survival, as an alternative to
improbable extinction, may be widespread.</p>

<p>Matter forms an instrument, a means of manifestation,
but it need not be the only one possible. We have
utilised matter to build up this beautiful bodily mechanism,
but, when that is done with, <i>the constructive ability
remains</i>; and it can be expected to exercise its organising
powers in other than material environment. If this
hypothesis be true at all (and admittedly I am now making
hypothesis) <i>it must be true of all forms of life</i>; for what
the process of evolution has accomplished here may
be accomplished elsewhere, under conditions at present
unknown.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
So I venture to surmise that the surroundings
of non-material existence will be far more homely and
habitual than people in general have been accustomed
to think likely.</p>

<p>And how do I know that the visible material body of
anything is all the body, or all the existence, it possesses?
Why should not things exist also, or have etherial counterparts,
in an etherial world? Perhaps everything has
already an etherial counterpart, of which our senses tell
us the material aspect only. I do not know. Such an
idea may be quoted as an absurdity; but if the evidence
drives me in that direction, in that direction I will go,
without undue resistance. There have been those who
do not wait to be driven, but who lead; and the inspired
guidance of Plotinus in that direction may secure more
attention, and attract more disciples, when the way is
illuminated by discoverable facts.</p>

<p>Meanwhile facts await discovery.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Passages from Plotinus, it may be remembered, are eloquently
translated by F. W. H. Myers, from the obscure and often ungrammatical
Greek, in <i>Human Personality</i>, vol. ii. pp. 289-291;
and readers of S.P.R. <i>Proceedings</i>, vol. xxii, pp. 108-172,
will remember the development by Mrs. Verall of the [Greek: kai autos
ouranos akum�n] motto prefixed to F. W. H. Myers's post-humously
published poem on Tennyson in <i>Fragments of Prose and Poetry</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[ 337]</a></span></p>

<p>My reference just above to teachings of Plotinus about the
kind of things to be met with in the other world, or the etherial
world, or whatever it may be called, is due to information from
Professor J. H. Muirhead that, roughly speaking, Plotinus teaches
that things there are on the same plan as things here: each thing
here having its counterpart or corresponding existence there,
though glorified and fuller of reality. Not to misrepresent this
doctrine, but to illustrate it as far as can be by a short passage,
Professor Muirhead has given me the following translation from
the <i>Enneads</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"But again let us speak thus: For since we hold that
<i>this</i> universe is framed after the pattern of <i>That</i>, every living
thing must needs first be There; and since Its Being is perfect,
all must be There. Heaven then must There be a living thing nor
void of what are here called stars; indeed such things belong to
heaven. Clearly too the earth which is There is not an empty void, but
much more full of life, wherein are all creatures that are here called
land animals and plants that are rooted in life. And sea is There,
and all water in ebb and flow and in abiding life, and all creatures
that are in the water. And air is a part of the all that is There,
and creatures of the air in accordance with the nature and laws of
air. For in the Living how should living things fail? How then
can any living thing fail to be There, seeing that as each of the
great parts of nature is, so needs must be the living things that
therein are? As then Heaven is, and There exists, so are and
exist all the creatures that inhabit it; nor can these fail to be, else
would those (on earth?) not be."</p>

<p class="right">
<i>Enn.</i> <span class="smcap">VI.</span> vii.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason why this strange utterance or speculation
is reproduced here is because it seems to some extent
to correspond with curious statements recorded in
another part of this book; <i>e.g.</i> in Chapter XIV, Part II.</p>

<p>I expect that it would be misleading to suppose that
the terms used by Plotinus really signify any difference of
locality. It may be nearer the truth to suppose that when
freed from our restricting and only matter-revealing senses
we become aware of much that was and is 'here' all the
time, interfused with the existence which we knew;&mdash;forming
part indeed of the one and only complete existence,
of which our present normal knowledge is limited to a
single aspect. We might think and speak of many interpenetrating
universes, and yet recognise that ultimately
they must be all one. It is not likely that the Present
differs from what we now call the Future except in our
mode of perceiving it.</p>

<span class="small">ON MEANS OF COMMUNICATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p>"In scientific truth there is no finality, and there should therefore
be no dogmatism. When this is forgotten, then science will
become stagnant, and its high-priests will endeavour to strangle
new learning at its birth."&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. A. Gregory</span>, <i>Discovery</i>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">How does mind communicate with mind? Our
accustomed process is singularly indirect.</p>

<p>Speech is the initiation of muscular movements,
under brain and nerve guidance, which result in the production
of atmospheric pulsations&mdash;alternate condensations
and rarefactions&mdash;which spread out in all directions
in a way that can be likened superficially to the spreading
of ripples on a pond. In themselves the aerial pulsations
have no psychical connotation, and are as purely mechanical
as are those ripples, though like the indentations
on the wax of a phonograph their sequence is cunningly
contrived; and it is in their sequence that the code lies&mdash;a
code which anyone who has struggled with a foreign
language knows is difficult to learn. Sound waves have
in some respects a still closer analogy with the etherial
pulsations generated at a wireless-telegraph sending station,
which affect all sensitive receiving instruments within
range and convey a code by their artificially induced
sequence.</p>

<p>Hearing is reception of a small modicum of the above
aerial pulsations, by suitable mechanism which enables
them to stimulate ingeniously contrived nerve-endings,
and so at length to affect auditory centres in the brain,
and to get translated into the same kind of consciousness
as was responsible for the original utterance.
The whole is done so quickly and easily, by the perfect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[ 339]</a></span>
physiological mechanism provided, that the indirect and
surprising nature of the process is usually overlooked;
as most things are when they have become familiar.
Wireless telegraphy is not an iota more marvellous,
but, being unfamiliar, it has aroused a sense of
wonder.</p>

<p>Writing and Reading by aid of black marks on a piece
of paper, perceived by means of the Ether instead of the
air, and through the agency of the eye instead of the ear,&mdash;though
the symbols are ultimately to be interpreted as if
heard,&mdash;hardly need elaboration in order to exhibit their
curiously artificial and complicated indirectness: and
in their case an element of delay, even a long time-interval&mdash;perhaps
centuries&mdash;may intervene between production
and reception.</p>

<p>Artistic representation also, such as painting or music,
though of a less articulate character, less dependent on
purely linguistic convention and less limited by nationality,
is still truly astonishing when intellectually regarded.
An arrangement of pigments designed for
the reception and modification and re-emission or
reflexion of ether-tremors, in the one case; and, in
the other, a continuous series of complicated vibrations
excited by grossly mechanical means; intervene
between the minds of painter and spectator, of composer
and auditor, or, in more general terms, between agent
and percipient,&mdash;again with possible great lapse of
time.</p>

<p>That ideas and feelings, thus indirectly and mechanically
transmitted or stored, can affect the sensitive soul
in unmistakable fashion, is a fact of experience; but
that deposits in matter are competent to produce so
purely psychic an effect can surely only be explained in
terms of the potentialities and previous experience of the
mind or soul itself. No emotional influence can be expressed,
or rendered intelligible, in terms of matter.
Matter is an indirect medium of communication between
mind and mind. That direct telepathic intercourse
should be able to occur between mind and mind, without
all this intermediate physical mechanism, is therefore
not really surprising. It has to be proved, no doubt,
but the fact is intrinsically less puzzling than many of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[ 340]</a></span>
those other facts to which we have grown hardened by
usage.</p>

<p>Why should telepathy be unfamiliar to us? Why
should it seem only an exceptional or occasional method
of communication? There is probably, as M. Bergson
has said, an evolutionary advantage in our present
almost exclusive limitation to mechanical and physical
methods of communication; for these are under muscular
control and can be shut off. We can isolate ourselves
from them, if not in a mechanical, then in a topographical
manner: we can go away, out of range. We
could not thus protect ourselves against insistent
telepathy. Hence probably the practical usefulness of
the inhibiting and abstracting power of the brain;
a power which in some lunatics is permanently
deficient.</p>

<p>Physical things can reach consciousness&mdash;if at all&mdash;only
through the brain; that remains true as regards
physical things, however much we may admit telepathy
from other minds; and, conversely, only through the
brain can we operate with conscious purpose on the
material world. To any more direct mental or spiritual
intercourse we are, unless specially awakened, temporarily
dead or asleep. There is some inversion of ordinary ideas
here, for a state of trance appears to rouse or free the
dormant faculties, and to render direct intercourse more
possible. At any rate it does this for some people.
For we find here and there, a few perfectly sane
individuals, from whom, when in a rather exceptional
state, the customary brain-limitation seems to be withdrawn
or withdrawable. Their minds cease to be
isolated for a time, and are accessible to more direct
influences. Not the familiar part of their minds, not
the part accustomed to operate and to be operated
on by the habitually used portion of brain, no, but
what is called a subliminal stratum of mind, a part
only accessible perhaps to physical things through an
ordinarily unused and only subconscious portion of
the brain.</p>

<p>The occurrence of such people, <i>i.e.</i> of people with such
exceptional and really simple faculties, could not have
been predicted or expected on a basis of everyday experience;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[ 341]</a></span>
but if evidence is forthcoming for their existence&mdash;even
although it be not quite of an ordinary character&mdash;and
if we can make examination of the subject-matter
and criticise the statements of fact which are thus receivable,
there is no sort of sense in opposing the facts
by adducing preconceived negative opinions about impossibility,
and declining to look into the evidence or
judge of the results. There were people once who would
not look at the satellites of Jupiter, lest their cherished
convictions should be disturbed. There was a mathematician
not long ago who would not see an experimental
demonstration of conical refraction, lest if it failed his
confidence in refined optical theory should be upset.
And so, strange to say, there are people to-day who deny
the fact, and condemn the investigation, of any manner of
communication outside the realm of ordinary commonplace
experience: having no ground at all for their denial
save prejudice.</p>

<p>Well, like other little systems, they have their day and
cease to be. We need not attend to them overmuch.
If the facts of the Universe have come within our contemplation,
a certain amount of contemporary blindness,
though it may surprise, need not perplex us. The study
of the material side of things, under the limitations appropriate
thereto, has done splendid service. Only gradually
can mental scope be enlarged to take in not only all this
but more also.</p>

<p>In so far as those who are open to the less well-defined
and more ambitious region are ignorant or unresponsive
to what has been achieved in the material realm, it is no
wonder that their asserted enlargement of scope is not
credited. It does not seem likely that a new revelation
has been vouchsafed to them, when they are so ignorant
concerning the other and already recognised kind of
Natural knowledge. They cannot indeed have attained
information through the same channels, or in the same
way. And it is this dislocation of knowledge, this difference
of atmosphere, this barely reconcilable attitude of
two diverse groups of people&mdash;though occasionally, by the
device of water-tight compartments, the same individual
has breathed both kinds of air and belonged to both
groups&mdash;it is this bifurcation of method that has retarded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[ 342]</a></span>
mutual understanding. There are pugnacious members
of either group who try to strengthen their own position
by decrying the methods of the other; and were it not
for the occurrence from time to time of a Wallace or a
Crookes, <i>i.e.</i> of men who combine in their own persons
something of both kinds of knowledge, attained not by
different but by similar methods&mdash;all their theses being
maintained and justified on scientific grounds, and after
experimental inquiry&mdash;the chances for a reasonable and
scientific outlook into a new region, and ultimately over
the border-line into the domain of religion, would not be
encouraging. The existence of such men, however, has
given the world pause, has sometimes checked its facile
abuse, and has brought it occasionally into a reflective,
perhaps now even into a partially receptive, mood. We
need not be in any hurry, though we can hardly help
hoping for quick progress if the new knowledge can in any
way alleviate the terrible amount of sorrow in the world
at present; moreover, if a new volume is to be opened in
man's study of the Universe, it is time that the early
chapters were being perused.</p>

<p>It may be asked, do I recommend all bereaved persons
to devote the time and attention which I have done
to getting communications and recording them? Most
certainly I do not. I am a student of the subject, and a
student often undertakes detailed labour of a special kind.
I recommend people in general to learn and realise that
their loved ones are still active and useful and interested
and happy&mdash;more alive than ever in one sense&mdash;and to
make up their minds to live a useful life till they rejoin
them.</p>

<p>What steps should be taken to gain this peaceful
assurance must depend on the individual. Some may
get it from the consolations of religion, some from the
testimony of trusted people, while some may find it
necessary to have first-hand experience of their own
for a time. And if this experience can be attained
privately, with no outside assistance, by quiet and meditation
or by favour of occasional waking dreams, so much
the better.</p>

<p>What people should not do, is to close their minds to
the possibility of continued existence except in some lofty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[ 343]</a></span>
and inaccessible and essentially unsuitable condition;
they should not selfishly seek to lessen pain by discouraging
all mention, and even hiding everything likely to
remind them, of those they have lost; nor should they
give themselves over to unavailing and prostrating grief.
Now is the time for action; and it is an ill return to
those who have sacrificed all and died for the Country
if those left behind do not throw off enervating distress
and helpless lamentation, and seek to live for the
Country and for humanity, to the utmost of their
power.</p>

<p>Any steps which are calculated to lead to this wholesome
result in any given instance are justified; and it is
not for me to offer advice as to the kind of activity most
appropriate to each individual case.
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>I have suggested that the new knowledge, when
generally established and incorporated with existing
systems, will have a bearing and influence on the region
hitherto explored by other faculties, and considered to be
the domain of faith. It certainly must be so, whether the
suggested expansion of scientific scope is welcomed or not.
Certainly the conclusions to which I myself have been led
by one mode of access are not contradictory of the conclusions
which have been arrived at by those who (naturally)
seem to me the more enlightened theologians;
though I must confess that with some of the ecclesiastical
superstructure which has descended to us from a bygone
day, a psychic investigator can have but little sympathy.
Indeed he only refrains from attacking it because he
feels that, left to itself, it will be superseded by higher
and better knowledge, and will die a natural death.
There is too much wheat mingled with the tares to
render it safe for any but an ecclesiastical expert to attempt
to uproot them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, although some of the official exponents of
Christian doctrine condemn any attempt to explore things
of this kind by secular methods; while others refrain from
countenancing any results thus obtained; there are many
who would utilise them in their teaching if they conscientiously
could, and a few who have already begun to
do so, on the strength of their own knowledge, however

COMMUNICATION</span></h2>

</div></div></div>

<p class="drop-cap">HOWEVER it be accomplished, and whatever reception
the present-day scientific world may give
to the assertion, there are many now who know,
by first-hand experience, that communication is possible
across the boundary&mdash;if there is a boundary&mdash;between the
world apprehended by our few animal-derived senses and
the larger existence concerning which our knowledge is
still more limited.</p>

<p>Communication is not easy, but it occurs; and
humanity has reason to be grateful to those few individuals
who, finding themselves possessed of the faculty
of mediumship, and therefore able to act as intermediaries,
allow themselves to be used for this purpose.</p>

<p>Such means of enlarging our knowledge, and entering
into relations with things beyond animal ken, can be abused
like any other power: it can be played with by the merely
curious, or it can be exploited in a very mundane and unworthy
way in the hope of warping it into the service of
selfish ends, in the same way as old and long accessible
kinds of knowledge have too often been employed. But
it can also be used reverently and seriously, for the very
legitimate purpose of comforting the sorrowful, helping
the bereaved, and restoring some portion of the broken
link between souls united in affection but separated for a
time by an apparently impassable barrier. The barrier is
turning out to be not hopelessly obdurate after all; intercourse
between the two states is not so impossible as had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[ 346]</a></span>
been thought; something can be learnt about occurrences
from either side; and gradually it is probable that a large
amount of consistent and fairly coherent knowledge will be
accumulated.</p>

<p>Meanwhile broken ties of affection have the first claim;
and early efforts at communication from the departed are
nearly always directed towards assuring survivors of the
fact of continued personal existence, towards helping them
to realise that changed surroundings have in no way
weakened love or destroyed memory, and urging upon
their friends with eager insistence that earthly happiness
need not be irretrievably spoiled by bereavement. For
purposes of this kind many trivial incidents are recalled,
such as are well adapted to convince intimate friends and
relatives that one particular intelligence, and no other,
must be the source from which the messages ultimately
spring, through whatever intermediaries they have to be
conveyed. And to people new to the subject such messages
are often immediately convincing.</p>

<p>Further thought, however, raises difficulties and doubts.
The gradually recognized possibility of what may be called
normal telepathy, or unconscious mind-reading from survivors,
raises hesitation&mdash;felt most by studious and
thoughtful people&mdash;about accepting such messages as irrefragable
evidence of persistent personal existence; and to
overcome this curious and unexpected and perhaps rather
artificial difficulty, it is demanded that facts shall be given
which are unknown to anyone present, and can only subsequently
be verified. Communications of this occasional
and exceptional kind are what are called, by psychic investigators,
more specifically 'evidential': and time and
perhaps good fortune may be required for their adequate
reception and critical appreciation. For it is manifest
that most things readily talked about between two
friends, and easily reproducible in hasty conversation, will
naturally be of a nature common to both, and on subjects
well within each other's knowledge.</p>

<p>The more recent development of an elaborate scheme
of 'cross-correspondence,' entered upon since the death of
specially experienced and critical investigators of the
S.P.R., who were familiar with all these difficulties, and
who have taken strong and most ingenious means to overcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[ 347]</a></span>
them, has made the proof, already very strong, now
almost crucial. The only alternative, in the best cases, is
to imagine a sort of supernormal mischievousness, so
elaborately misleading that it would have to be stigmatised
as vicious or even diabolical.</p>

<p>In most cases complete proof of this complicated and
cold-blooded kind is neither forthcoming nor is necessary:
indeed it can hardly be appreciated or understood by
non-studious people. Effective evidence is in most cases
of a different kind, and varies with the personality concerned.
It often happens that little personal touches,
incommunicable to others in their full persuasiveness,
sooner or later break down the last vestiges of legitimate
scepticism. What goes on beyond that will depend upon
personal training and interest. With many, anything like
scientific inquiry lapses at this point, and communication
resolves itself into emotional and domestic interchange of
ordinary ideas. But in a few cases the desire to give new
information is awakened; and when there is sufficient receptivity,
and, what is very important, a competent and
suitable Medium for anything beyond commonplace messages,
instructive and general information may be forthcoming.
An explanation or description of the methods of
communication, for instance, as seen from their side; or
some information concerning the manner of life there;
and occasionally even some intelligent attempt to lessen
human difficulties about religious conceptions, and to give
larger ideas about the Universe as a whole,&mdash;all these attempts
have been made. But they always insist that their
information is but little greater than ours, and that they
are still fallible gropers after truth,&mdash;of which they keenly
feel the beauty and importance, but of which they realise
the infinitude, and their own inadequacy of mental grasp,
quite as clearly as we do here.</p>

<p>These are what we call the 'unverifiable' communications;
for we cannot bring them to book by subsequent
terrestrial inquiry in the same way as we can test information
concerning personal or mundane affairs. Information
of the higher kind has often been received, but has seldom
been published; and it is difficult to know what value to
put upon it, or how far it is really trustworthy.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think, however&mdash;with a growing number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[ 348]</a></span>
of serious students of the subject&mdash;that the time is
getting ripe now for the production and discussion of
material of this technically unverifiable kind; to be scrutinised
and tested by internal consistency and inherent
probability, in the same sort of way as travellers' tales
have to be scrutinised and tested. But until humanity as
a whole has taken the initial step, and shown itself willing
to regard such communications as within the range of
possibility, it may be unwise to venture far in this more
ambitious direction.</p>

<p>It has nevertheless been suggested, from a philosophic
point of view, that strict proof of individual survival must
in the last resort depend on examination and collation of
these 'travellers' tales,' rather than on any kind of resuscitation
of the past; because, until we know more about
memory, it is possible to conjecture, as I think Professor
Bergson does, that all the past is potentially accessible to a
super-subliminal faculty for disinterring it. And so one
might, in a sceptical mood, when confronted with records
of apparently personal reminiscence, attribute them to an
unconscious exercise of this faculty, and say with Tennyson</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem width24">
<div class="stanza">
<p><span style="margin-left: 7em;">"I hear a wind</span></p>
<p>Of memory murmuring the past."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>I do not myself regard this impersonal memory as a
reasonable hypothesis, I think that the simpler view is
likely to be the truer one, so I attach importance to trivial
reminiscences and characteristic personal touches; but I
do agree that abstention from recording and publishing,
however apologetically, those other efforts has had the
effect of making ill-informed people&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> people with very
little personal experience&mdash;jump to the conclusion that all
communications are of a trivial and contemptible nature.</p>

<span class="small">ON THE CONTENTION THAT ALL PSYCHIC COMMUNICATIONS<br />
ARE OF A TRIVIAL NATURE<br />
AND DEAL WITH INSIGNIFICANT TOPICS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THAT such a contention as that mentioned at the
end of the preceding chapter is false is well known
to people of experience; but so long as the demand
for verification and proof of identity persists&mdash;and it will
be long indeed before they can be dispensed with&mdash;so
long are trifling reminiscences the best way to achieve the
desired end. The end in this case amply explains and
justifies the means. Hence it is that novices and critics
are naturally and properly regaled with references to
readily remembered and verifiable facts; and since these
facts, to be useful, must not be of the nature of public
news, nor anything which can be gleaned from biographical
or historical records, they usually relate to trifling family
affairs or other humorous details such as seem likely to
stay in the memory. It can freely be admitted that such
facts are only redeemed from triviality by the affectionate
recollections interlinked with them, and by the motive which
has caused them to be reproduced. For their special purpose
they may be admirable; and there is no sort of triviality
about the thing to be proven by them. The idea that a
departed friend ought to be occupied wholly and entirely
with grave matters, and ought not to remember jokes and
fun, is a gratuitous claim which has to be abandoned.
Humour does not cease with earth-life. Why should
it?</p>

<p>It should be evident that communications concerning
deeper matters are not similarly serviceable as proof of
identity, though they may have a value and interest of
their own; but it is an interest which could not be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[ 350]</a></span>
legitimately aroused until the first step&mdash;the recognition of veridical
intercourse&mdash;had been taken; for, as a rule, they
are essentially unverifiable. Of such communications a multitude
could be quoted; and almost at random I select a
few specimens from the automatic writings of the gentleman
and schoolmaster known to a former generation as
<i>M.A.Oxon.</i><a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
Take this one, which happens to be printed
in a current issue of <i>Light</i> (22 April 1916), with the statement
that it occurs in one of M.A.Oxon.'s subliminally
written and private notebooks, under date 12 July 1873&mdash;many
others will be found in the selections which he himself
extracted from his own script and published in a book called
<i>Spirit Teachings</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"You do not sufficiently grasp the scanty hold that religion
has upon the mass of mankind, nor the adaptability of what we
preach to the wants and cravings of men. Or perhaps it is
necessary that you be reminded of what you cannot see clearly
in your present state and among your present associations. You
cannot see, as we see, the carelessness that has crept over men as
to the future. Those who have thought over their future have
come to know that they can find out nothing about it, except,
indeed, that what man pretends to tell is foolish, contradictory,
and unsatisfying. His reasoning faculties convince him that the
Revelation of God contains very plain marks of human origin;
that it will not stand the test of sifting such as is applied to works
professedly human; and that the priestly fiction that reason is
no measure of revelation, and that it must be left on the threshold
of inquiry and give place to faith, is a cunningly planned means
of preventing man from discovering the errors and contradictions
which throng the pages of the Bible. Those who reason discover
this soon; those who do not, betake themselves to the refuge of
Faith, and become blind devotees, fanatical, irrational, and bigoted;
conformed to a groove in which they have been educated and
from which they have not broken loose simply because they
have not dared to think. It would be hard for man to devise a
means [more capable] of cramping the mind and dwarfing the
spirit's growth than this persuading of a man that he must not
think about religion. It is one which paralyses all freedom of
thought and renders it almost impossible for the soul to rise. The
spirit is condemned to a hereditary religion whether suited or not to
its wants. That which may have suited a far-off ancestor may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[ 351]</a></span>
quite unsuited to a struggling soul that lives in other times from
those in which such ideas had vitality. The spirit's life is so made
a question of birth and of locality. It is a question over which he
can exercise no control, whether he is Christian, Mohammedan,
or, as ye say, heathen: whether his God be the Great Spirit of
the Red Indian, or the fetish of the savage; whether his prophet
be Christ or Mahomet or Confucius; in short, whether his notion
of religion be that of East, West, North, or South; for in all
these quarters men have evolved for themselves a theology which
they teach their children to believe.</p>

<p>"The days are coming when this geographical sectarianism will
give place before the enlightenment caused by the spread of our
revelation, for which men are far riper than you think. The time
draws nigh apace when the sublime truths of Spiritualism, rational
and noble as they are when viewed by man's standard, shall wipe
away from the face of God's earth the sectarian jealousy and theological
bitterness, the anger and ill-will, the folly and stupidity,
which have disgraced the name of religion and the worship of God;
and man shall see in a clearer light the Supreme Creator and the
spirit's eternal destiny.</p>

<p>"We tell you, friend, that the end draws nigh; the night of
ignorance is passing fast; the shackles which priestcraft has
strung round the struggling souls shall be knocked off, and in
place of fanatical folly and ignorant speculation and superstitious
belief, ye shall have a reasonable religion and a knowledge of the
reality of the spirit-world and of the ministry of angels with you.
Ye shall know that the dead are alive indeed, living as they lived
on earth, but more truly, ministering to you with undiminished
love, animated in their perpetual intercourse with the same affection
which they had whilst yet incarned."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any one of these serious messages can be criticised
and commented upon with hostility and suspicion; they
are not suited to establish the first premise of the
argument for continuance of personality; and if they
were put forward as part of the proof of survival,
then perhaps the hostility would be legitimate. It
ought to be clear that they are not to be taken as oracular
utterances, or as anything vastly superior to the
capabilities of the medium through whom they come,&mdash;though
in fact they often are superior to any known
power of a given medium, and are frequently characteristic
of the departed personality, as we knew
him, who is purporting to be the Communicator: though
this remark is not applicable to the particular class of
impersonal messages here selected for quotation. Yet in
all cases they must surely be more or less sophisticated by
the channel, and by the more or less strained method of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[ 352]</a></span>
communication, and must share some of its limitations and
imperfections.</p>

<p>However that may be, it is proper to quote them occasionally,
as here; not as specially profound utterances, but
merely in contradiction of the imaginary and false thesis
that only trivial and insignificant subjects are dealt with in
automatic writings and mediumistic utterances. For such
utterances&mdash;whatever their value or lack of value&mdash;are
manifestly conclusive against that gratuitous and ignorant
supposition. Whatever is thought of them, they are at
least conceived in a spirit of earnestness, and are characterised
by a genuine fervour that may be properly called
religious.</p>

<p>I now quote a few more of the records published in
the book cited above,&mdash;in this case dealing with Theological
questions and puzzles in the mind of the automatic writer
himself:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"All your fancied theories about God have filtered down to
you through human channels; the embodiments of human cravings
after knowledge of Him; the creation of minds that were
undeveloped, whose wants were not your wants, whose God, or
rather whose notions about God are not yours. You try hard to
make the ideas fit in, but they will not fit, because they are the
product of divers degrees of development...."</p>

<p>"God! Ye know Him not! One day, when the Spirit stands
within the veil which shrouds the spirit world from mortal gaze,
you shall wonder at your ignorance of Him whom you have
so foolishly imagined! He is far other than you have pictured
Him. Were He such as you have pictured Him, were He such as
you think, He would avenge on presumptuous man the insults
which he puts on his Creator. But He is other, far other than
man's poor grovelling mind can grasp, and He pities and forgives
the ignorance of the blind mortal who paints Him after a self-imagined
pattern.... When you rashly complain of us that our
teaching to you controverts that of the Old Testament, we can
but answer that it does indeed controvert that old and repulsive
view ... but that it is in fullest accord with that divinely
inspired revelation of Himself which He gave through Jesus
Christ&mdash;a revelation which man has done so much to debase, and
from which the best of the followers of Christ have so grievously
fallen away."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And again, in answer to other doubts and questions in
the mind of the automatist as to the legitimacy of the
means of communication, and his hesitation about employing
a means which he knew was sometimes prostituted by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[ 353]</a></span>
knaves to unworthy and frivolous or even base objects,&mdash;very
different from those served by humorous and friendly
family messages, about which no one with a spark of
human feeling has a word to say when once they have
realised their nature and object,&mdash;the writing continued
thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"If there be nought in what we say of God and of man's
after-life that commends itself to you, it must be that your mind
has ceased to love the grander and simpler conceptions which it
had once learned to drink in...."</p>

<p>"Cease to be anxious about the minute questions which are
of minor moment. Dwell much on the great, the overwhelming
necessity for a clearer revealing of the Supreme; on the blank
and cheerless ignorance of God and of us which has crept over
the world: on the noble creed we teach, on the bright future we
reveal. Cease to be perplexed by thoughts of an imagined Devil.
For the honest, pure, and truthful soul there is no Devil nor
Prince of Evil such as theology has feigned.... The clouds of
sorrow and anguish of soul may gather round [such a man] and
his spirit may be saddened with the burden of sin&mdash;weighed down
with consciousness of surrounding misery and guilt, but no fabled
Devil can gain dominion over him, or prevail to drag down his
soul to hell. All the sadness of spirit, the acquaintance with
grief, the intermingling with guilt, is part of the experience, in
virtue of which his soul shall rise hereafter. The guardians are
training and fitting it by those means to progress, and jealously
protect it from the dominion of the foe.</p>

<p>"It is only they who, by a fondness for evil, by a lack of
spiritual and excess of corporeal development, attract to themselves
the congenial spirits of the undeveloped who have left the
body but not forgotten its desires. These alone risk incursion of
evil. These by proclivity attract evil, and it dwells with them
at their invitation. They attract the lower spirits who hover
nearest Earth, and who are but too ready to rush in and mar our
plans, and ruin our work for souls. These are they of whom you
speak when you say in haste, that the result of Spiritualism is not
for good. You err, friend. Blame not us that the lower spirits
manifest for those who bid them welcome. Blame man's insensate
folly, which will choose the low and grovelling rather than
the pure and elevated. Blame his foolish laws, which daily
hurry into a life for which they are unprepared, thousands of
spirits, hampered and dragged down by a life of folly and sin,
which has been fostered by custom and fashion. Blame the ginshops,
and the madhouses, and the prisons, and the encouraged
lusts and fiendish selfishness of man. This it is which damns
legions of spirits&mdash;not, as ye fancy, in a sea of material fire, but
in the flames of perpetuated lust, condemned to burn itself out
in hopeless longing till the purged soul rises through the fire and
surmounts its dead passions. Yes, blame these and kindred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[ 354]</a></span>
causes, if there be around undeveloped intelligences who shock
you by their deception, and annoy you by frivolity and falsehood."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suppose that the worst that can be said about writing
of this kind is that it consists of 'sermon-stuffe' such as
could have been presumably invented&mdash;whether consciously
or unconsciously&mdash;by the automatic writer himself. And
the fact that with some of it he tended to disagree, proves
no more than the corresponding kind of unexpected argumentation
experienced by some dreamers. (Cf. L. P.
Jacks, <i>Hibbert Journal</i>, July, 1916.) The same kind of explanation
may serve for both phenomena, but I do not know
what that explanation is.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><span class="gesperrt">CHAPTER XIII</span><br />
<span class="small">ON THE MANNER OF COMMUNICATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PERHAPS the commonest and easiest method of communication
is what is called 'automatic writing'&mdash;the
method by which the above examples were received&mdash;i.e.
writing performed through the agency of subconscious
intelligence; the writer leaving his or her hand at liberty
to write whatever comes, without attempting to control it,
and without necessarily attending at the time to what is
being written.</p>

<p>That a novice will usually get nothing, or mere nonsense
or scribbling, in this way is obvious: the remarkable thing
is that some persons are thus able to get sense, and to tap
sources of information outside their normal range. If a
rudiment of such power exists, it is possible, though not
always desirable, to cultivate it; but care, pertinacity, and
intelligence are needed to utilise a faculty of this kind.
Unless people are well-balanced and self-critical and wholesomely
occupied, they had better leave the subject alone.</p>

<p>In most cases of fully-developed automatism known
to me the automatist reads what comes, and makes suitable
oral replies or comments to the sentences as they appear:
so that the whole has then the effect of a straightforward
conversation of which one side is spoken and the other written&mdash;the
speaking side being usually rather silent and reserved,
the writing side free and expansive.</p>

<p>Naturally not every person has the power of cultivating
this simple form of what is technically known as motor automatism,
one of the recognised subliminal forms of activity;
but probably more people could do it if they tried; though
for some people it would be injudicious, and for many
others hardly worth while.</p>

<p>The intermediate mentality employed in this process
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[ 356]</a></span>
seems to be a usually submerged or dream-like stratum of
the automatist whose hand is being used. The hand is probably
worked by its usual physiological mechanism, guided
and controlled by nerve centres not in the most conscious
and ordinarily employed region of the brain. In some cases
the content or subject-matter of the writing may emanate
entirely from these nerve centres, and be of no more
value than a dream; as is frequently the case with the more
elementary automatism set in action by the use of
instruments known as 'planchette' and 'ouija,' often
employed by beginners. But when the message turns
out to be of evidential value it is presumably because
this subliminal portion of the person is in touch,
either telepathically or in some other way, with intelligences
not ordinarily accessible,&mdash;with living people at a
distance perhaps, or more often with the apparently more
accessible people who have passed on, for whom distance
in the ordinary sense seems hardly to exist, and whose links
of connexion are of a kind other than spatial. It need
hardly be said that proof of communion of this kind
is absolutely necessary, and has to be insisted on; but experience
has demonstrated that now and again sound proof
is forthcoming.</p>

<p>Another method, and one that turns out to be still more
powerful, is for the automatist not only to take off his or
her attention from what is being transmitted through his
or her organism, but to become comprehensively unconscious
and go into a trance. In that case it appears that the
physiological mechanism is more amenable to control, and
is less sophisticated by the ordinary intelligence of the
person to whom it normally belongs; so that messages of
importance and privacy may be got through. But the messages
have to be received and attended to by another person;
for in such cases, when genuine, the entranced person
on waking up is found to be ignorant of what has been
either written or uttered. In this state, speech is as common
as writing, probably more common because less troublesome
to the recipient, <i>i.e.</i> the friend or relative to whom or
for whom messages are being thus sent. The communicating
personality during trance may be the same as the one
operating the hand without trance, and the messages may
have the same general character as those got by automatic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[ 357]</a></span>
writing, when the consciousness is not suspended
but only in temporary and local abeyance; but in the
trance state a dramatic characterisation is usually imparted
to the proceedings, by the appearance of an entity called a
'Control,' who works the body of the automatist in the
apparent absence of its customary manager. This personality
is believed by some to be merely the subliminal
self of the entranced person, brought to the surface, or
liberated and dramatised into a sort of dream existence,
for the time. By others it is supposed to be a healthy
and manageable variety of the more or less pathological
phenomenon known to physicians and psychiatrists as cases
of dual or multiple personality. By others again it is believed
to be in reality the separate intelligence which it
claims to be.</p>

<p>But however much can be and has been written on
this subject, and whatever different opinions may be
held, it is universally admitted that the <i>dramatic semblance</i>
of the control is undoubtedly that of a separate person,&mdash;a
person asserted to be permanently existing on the other
side, and to be occupied on that side in much the same
functions as the medium is on this. The duty of controlling
and transmitting messages seems to be laid upon such
a one&mdash;it is his special work. The dramatic character of
most of the controls is so vivid and self-consistent, that
whatever any given sitter or experimenter may feel is
the probable truth concerning their real nature, the
simplest way is to humour them by taking them at their
face value and treating them as separate and responsible
and real individuals. It is true that in the case of some
mediums, especially when overdone or tired, there are
evanescent and absurd obtrusions every now and then, which
cannot be seriously regarded. Those have to be eliminated;
and for anyone to treat them as real people would
be ludicrous; but undoubtedly the serious controls show
a character and personality and memory of their own, and
they appear to carry on as continuous an existence as
anyone else whom one only meets occasionally for conversation.
The conversation can be taken up at the point
where it left off, and all that was said appears to be remarkably
well remembered by the appropriate control; while
usually memory of it is naturally and properly repudiated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[ 358]</a></span>
by another control, even when operating through the same
medium; and the entranced medium knows nothing of it
afterwards after having completely woke up.</p>

<p>So clearly is the personality of the control brought
out, in the best cases, so clear also are the statements of
the communicators that the control who is kindly transmitting
their messages is a real person, that I am disposed
to accept their assertions, and to regard a control, when
not a mere mischievous and temporary impersonation, as
akin on their side to the person whom we call a medium on
ours.</p>

<p>The process of regular communication&mdash;apart from the
exceptional more direct privilege occasionally vouchsafed
to people in extreme sorrow&mdash;thus seems to involve normally
a double medium of communication, and the
activity of several people. First there is the 'Communicator'
or originator of ideas and messages on the other
side. Then there is the 'control' who accepts and transmits
the messages by setting into operation a physical
organism lent for the occasion. Then there is the 'Medium'
or person whose normal consciousness is in abeyance
but whose physiological mechanism is being used. And
finally there is the 'Sitter'&mdash;a rather absurd name&mdash;the
recipient of the messages, who reads or hears and answers
them, and for whose benefit all this trouble is taken. In
many cases there is also present a Note-taker to record all
that is said, whether by sitters or by or through the medium;
and it is clear that the note-taker should pay special
attention to and carefully record any hints or information
either purposely or accidentally imparted by the
sitter.</p>

<p>In scientific and more elaborately conducted cases there
is also some one present who is known as the Experimenter
in charge&mdash;a responsible and experienced person
who looks after the health and safety of the medium, who
arranges the circumstances and selects the sitters, making
provision for anonymity and other precautions, and who
frequently combines with his other functions the duties
of note-taker.</p>

<p>In oral or voice sittings the function of the note-taker
is more laborious and more responsible than in writing
sittings; for these latter to a great extent supply their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[ 359]</a></span>
own notes. Only as the trance-writing is blindfold, <i>i.e.</i>
done with shut eyes and head averted, it is rather illegible
without practice; and so the experimenter in charge frequently
finds it necessary to assist the sitter, to whom it
is addressed, by deciphering it and reading it aloud as it
comes&mdash;rather a tiring process; at the same time jotting
down, usually on the same paper, the remarks which the
sitter makes in reply, or the questions from time to time
asked. Unless this is done the subsequent automatic record
lacks a good deal of clearness, and sometimes lacks intelligibility.</p>

<p>For a voice-sitting the note-taker must be a rapid writer,
and if able to employ shorthand has an advantage. Sometimes
a stenographer is introduced; but the presence of a
stranger, or of any person not intimately concerned, is liable
to hamper the distinctness and fulness of a message; and
may prevent or retard the occurrence of such emotional
episodes as are from time to time almost inevitable in the
cases&mdash;alas too numerous at present&mdash;where the sitter has
been recently and violently bereaved.</p>

<p>It is perhaps noteworthy&mdash;though it may not be interesting
or intelligible to a novice&mdash;that communicators wishing
to give private communications seldom or never object
to the presence of the actual 'medium'&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the one on our
side. That person seems to be regarded as absent, or practically
non-existent for a time; the person whose presence
they sometimes resent at first is the 'control,' <i>i.e.</i>
the intelligence on their side who is ready to receive and
transmit their message, somewhat perhaps as an Eastern
scribe is ready to write the love-letters of illiterate persons.</p>

<p>As to the presence of a note-taker or third person on
our side, such person is taken note of by the control, and
when anything private or possibly private is mentioned&mdash;details
of illnesses or such like&mdash;that third person is often
ordered out of the room. Sometimes the experimenter
in charge is likewise politely dispensed with, and under these
circumstances the sitting occasionally takes on a poignant
character in which note-taking by the deeply affected sitter
becomes a practical impossibility. But this experience is
comparatively rare; it must not be expected, and cannot
wisely be forced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[ 360]</a></span></p>

<p>Another circumstance which makes me think that the
more responsible kind of control is a real person, is that
sometimes, after gained experience, the Communicator himself
takes control, and speaks or writes in the first person,
not only as a matter of first-person-reporting, which frequently
occurs, but really in his own proper person and with
many of his old characteristics. So if one control is a real
person I see no reason against the probability of others
being real likewise. I cannot say that the tone of voice or
the handwriting is often thus reproduced&mdash;though it is, for
a few moments, by special effort sometimes; but the unusual
physiological mechanism accounts for outstanding or
residual differences. Apart from that, the peculiarities,
the attitudes, the little touches of manner, are often more
or less faithfully reproduced, although the medium may
have known nothing of the person concerned. And the
characteristic quality of the message, and the kind of subjects
dealt with, become still more marked in such cases
of actual control, than when everything has to be transmitted
through a kindly stranger control, to whom things
of a recondite or technical character may appear rather as
a meaningless collocation of words, very difficult to remember
and reproduce.
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h3>NOTE ON DIFFICULTY OF REMEMBERING NAMES</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>When operating indirectly in the ordinary way through a control
and a medium, it usually appears to be remarkably difficult
to get names transmitted. Most mediums are able to convey a
name only with difficulty. Now plainly a name, especially the
proper name of a person, is a very conventional and meaningless
thing: it has very few links to connect it with other items in
memory; and hence arises the normally well-known difficulty of
recalling one. Conscious effort made to recover a name seems to
inhibit the power of doing so: the best plan is to leave it, and
let subconsciousness work. An example occurred to me the other
day, when I tried to remember the name of a prominent statesman
or ex-Prime Minister whom I had met in Australia. What
I seemed to recollect was that the name began with "D," and I
made several shots at it, which I recorded. The effort went on
at intervals for days, since I thought it would be an instructive
experiment. I know now, a month or two later, without any
effort and without looking it up, that the name was Deakin; but
what my shots at it were I do not remember. I will have the
page in the note-book looked up and reproduced here, as an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[ 361]</a></span>
example of memory-groping, at intervals, during more than one
day. Here they are:&mdash;D. Dering, Denman, Deeming, Derriman,
Derring, Deeley, Dempster, Denting, Desman, Deering.</p>

<p>Now I knew the name quite well, and have known it for long,
and have taken some interest in the gentleman who owns it; and
I am known by some members of my family to have done so.
Hence if I had been on 'the other side' and could only get as
far as D, it would have seemed rather absurd to anyone whose
memory for names is good. But indeed I have had times when
names very much more familiar to me than that could not on
the spur of the moment be recalled&mdash;not always even the initial
letter; though, for some reason or other, the initial letter is
certainly easier than the word.</p>

<p>The kind of shots which I made at the name before recalling
it&mdash;which it may seem frivolous to have actually recorded&mdash;are
reminiscent of the kind of shots which are made by mediums
under control when they too are striving after a name; and it
was a perception of this analogy which caused me to jot down
my own guesses, or what, in the case of a medium, we should
impolitely call 'fishing.' I think that the name was certainly
in my memory though it would not come through my brain. The
effort is like the effort to use a muscle not often or ever used&mdash;say
the outer ear&mdash;one does not know which string to pull, so to
speak, or, more accurately, which nerve to stimulate, and the
result is a peculiarly helpless feeling, akin to stammering. In
the case of a medium, I suppose the name is often in the mind
of the communicator, but it will not come through the control.
The control sometimes describes it as being spoken or shown
but not clearly caught. The communicator often does not know
whether a medium has successfully conveyed it or not.</p>

<p>"If man, then, shall attempt to sound and fathom the depths
that lie not without him, but within, analogy may surely warn
him that the first attempts of his rude <i>psychoscopes</i> to give precision
and actuality to thought will grope among 'beggarly elements'&mdash;will
be concerned with things grotesque, or trivial, or
obscure. Yet here also one handsbreadth of reality gives better
footing than all the castles of our dream; here also by beginning
with the least things we shall best learn how great things may
remain to do."&mdash;F. W. H. M., Introduction to <i>Phantasms of the
Living</i>
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I MUST not shirk a rather queer subject which yet
needs touching upon, though it bristles with theoretical
difficulties; and that is the rationale of one of
the most elementary methods of ultra-normal communication,
a method which many find practically the easiest to
begin with.</p>

<p>It is possible to get communication of a kind, not by
holding a pencil in the fingers, but by placing the hand on
a larger piece of wood not at all adapted for writing with.
The movements are then coarser, and the code more elementary;
but in principle, when the procedure is analysed,
it is seen not to be essentially different. It may be more
akin to semaphore-arm signalling or flag-wagging; but any
device whereby mental activity can translate itself into
movements of matter will serve for subliminal as well as
for conscious action; and messages by tilting of a table,
though crude and elementary, are not really so surprising or
absurd as at first sight they seem. The tilts of a telegraphic
operator's key are still more restricted; but they serve. A
pen or pencil is an inanimate piece of matter guided by the
fingers. A planchette is a mere piece of wood, and when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[ 363]</a></span>
touched it must be presumed to be guided by the muscles,&mdash;though
there is often an illusion, as with the twig of the
dowser, that the inanimate object is moved directly,
and not by muscular intervention. So also we may assume
that a table or other piece of furniture is tilted or
moved by regular muscular force: certainly it can only
move at the expense of the energy of the medium or of
people present. And yet in all these cases the substance of
the message may be foreign to the mind of anyone
touching the instrument, and the guidance necessary for
sense and relevance need not be exercised by their own
consciousness.</p>

<p>When a table or similar rough instrument is employed,
the ostensible communicators say that they feel more
<i>directly</i> in touch with the sitters than when they operate
through an intermediary or 'control' on their side,&mdash;as they
appear to find it necessary to do for actual speech
or writing,&mdash;and accordingly they find themselves able to
give more private messages, and also to reproduce
names and technicalities with greater facility and precision.
The process of spelling out words in this way is a
slow one, much slower than writing, and therefore the
method labours under disadvantages, but it seems to possess
advantages which to some extent counterbalance
them.</p>

<p>Whether it sounds credible or not, and it is certainly
surprising, I must testify that when a thing of any
mobility is controlled in this more direct way, it is able to
convey touches of emotion and phases of intonation, so to
speak, in a most successful manner. A telegraph key could
hardly do it, its range of movement is too restricted, it
operates only in a discontinuous manner, by make and
break; but a light table, under these conditions, seems no
longer inert, it behaves as if animated. For the time it is
animated&mdash;somewhat perhaps as a violin or piano is animated
by a skilled musician and schooled to his will,&mdash;and
the dramatic action thus attained is very remarkable. It
can exhibit hesitation, it can exhibit certainty; it can seek
for information, it can convey it; it can apparently ponder
before giving a reply; it can welcome a new-comer; it can
indicate joy or sorrow, fun or gravity; it can keep time
with a song as if joining in the chorus; and, most notable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[ 364]</a></span>
of all, it can exhibit affection in an unmistakable
manner.</p>

<p>The hand of a writing medium can do these things too;
and that the whole body of a normal person can display
these emotions is a commonplace. Yet they are all pieces
of matter, though some are more permanently animated
than others. But all are animated temporarily,&mdash;not
one of them permanently,&mdash;and there appears to be no sharp
line of demarcation. What we have to realise is that
matter in any form is able to act as agent to the
soul, and that by aid of matter various emotions as well
as intelligence can be temporarily incarnated and displayed.</p>

<p>The extraction of elementary music from all manner
of unlikely objects&mdash;kitchen utensils, for instance&mdash;is a
known stage-performance. The utilisation of unlikely objects
for purposes of communication, though it would not
have been expected, may have to be included in the same
general category.</p>

<p>With things made for the purpose, from a violin to the
puppets of a marionette show, we know that simple human
passions can be shown and can be roused. With things
made for quiet other purposes it turns out that the same
sort of possibility exists.</p>

<p>Table-tilting is an old and despised form of amusement,
known to many families and often wisely discarded; but
with care and sobriety and seriousness even this can be
used as a means of communication; and the amount of
mediumistic power necessary for this elementary form of
psychic activity appears to be distinctly less than would be
required for more elaborate methods.</p>

<p>One thing it is necessary clearly to realise and admit,
namely that in all cases when an object is moved by direct
contact of an operator's body, whether the instrument be a
pencil or a piece of wood, unconscious muscular guidance
must be allowed for; and anything that comes through of
a kind known to or suspected by the operator must be discounted.
Sometimes, however, the message comes in an
unexpected and for the moment puzzling form, and sometimes
it conveys information unknown to him. It is by
the content of the communication that its supernormal value
must be estimated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[ 365]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are many obvious disadvantages about a Table Sitting,
especially in the slowness of the communications and in the fact
that the sitter has to do most of the talking; whereas when
some personality is controlling a medium, the sitters need say
very little.</p>

<p>But, as said above, there are some communicators who object
to a control's presence, especially if they have anything private
to say; and these often prefer the table because it seems to bring
them more directly into contact with the sitter, without an intermediary.
They seem to ignore the presence of the medium on
our side, notwithstanding the fact that, at a table sitting, she is
present in her own consciousness and is aware of what goes on;
they appear to be satisfied with having dispensed with the medium
on their side. Moreover, it is in some cases found that information
can be conveyed in a briefer and more direct manner, not having
to be wrapped up in roundabout phrases, that names can be given
more easily, and direct questions answered better, through the table
than through a control.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that under control every medium has
some peculiarities. Mrs. Leonard, for instance, is a very straightforward
and honest medium, but not a particularly strong one.
Accordingly anything like conversation and free interchange of
ideas is hardly possible, and direct questions seldom receive direct
answers, when put to the communicator through Feda.</p>

<p>I have known mediums much more powerful in this respect,
so that free conversation with one or two specially skilled communicators
was quite possible, and interchange of ideas almost
as easy as when the communicator was in the flesh. But instances
of that kind are hardly to be expected among hard-worked professional
mediums.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I shall not in this volume touch upon still more puzzling
and still more directly and peculiarly physical phenomena,
such as are spoken of as 'direct voice,' 'direct writing,' and
'materialisation.' In these strange and, from one point of
view, more advanced occurrences, though lower in another
sense, inert matter appears to be operated on without the
direct intervention of physiological mechanism. And yet
such mechanism must be in the neighbourhood. I am inclined
to think that these weird phenomena, when established,
will be found to shade off into those other methods
that I have been speaking of, and that no complete theory
of either can be given until more is known about both. This
is one of the facts which causes me to be undogmatic about
the certainty that all movements, even under contact, are
initiated in the muscles. I only here hold up a warning
against premature decision. The whole subject of psycho-physical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[ 366]</a></span>
interaction and activity requires attention in due
time and place; but the ground is now more treacherous,
the pitfalls more numerous, and the territory to many minds
comparatively unattractive. Let it wait until long-range
artillery has beaten down some of the entanglements, before
organised forces are summoned to advance.</p>

<span class="small">ATTITUDE OF THE WISE AND PRUDENT</span></h2>

<p>"The vagueness and confusion inevitable at the beginning of
a novel line of research, [are] naturally distasteful to the <i>savant</i>
accustomed to proceed by measurable increments of knowledge
from experimental bases already assured. Such an one, if he
reads this book, may feel as though he had been called away from
an ordnance survey, conducted with a competent staff and familiar
instruments, to plough slowly with inexperienced mariners through
some strange ocean where beds of entangling seaweed cumber
the trackless way. We accept the analogy; but we would remind
him that even floating weeds of novel genera may foreshow a land
unknown; and that it was not without ultimate gain to men
that the straining keels of Columbus first pressed through the
Sargasso Sea."&mdash;F. W. H. M., Introduction to <i>Phantasms of the
Living</i>
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is rather remarkable that the majority of learned
men have closed their minds to what have seemed bare
and simple facts to many people. Those who call themselves
spiritualists have an easy and simple faith; they
interpret their experiences in the most straightforward
and unsophisticated manner, and some of them
have shown unfortunately that they can be led into
credulity and error, without much difficulty, by unscrupulous
people. Nevertheless, that simple-hearted
folk are most accessible to new facts seems to be rather
accordant with history. Whenever, not by reasoning but
by direct experience, knowledge has been enlarged, or when
a revelation has come to the human race through the agency
of higher powers, it is not the wise but the simple who are
first to receive it. This cannot be used as an argument
either way; the simple may be mistaken, and may too blithely
interpret their sense-impressions in the most obvious
manner; just as on the other hand the eyes of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[ 368]</a></span>
learned may be closed to anything which appears disconnected
from their previous knowledge. For after all
it is inevitable that any really new order of things must
be so disconnected; some little time must elapse before
the weight of facts impel the learned in a new direction,
and meanwhile the unlearned may be absorbing direct experience,
and in their own fashion may be forging ahead.
It is an example of the ancient paradox propounded in
and about 1 <i>Cor.</i> i. 26; and no fault need be found with
what is natural.</p>

<p>It behoves me to mention in particular the attitude of
men of science, of whom I may say <i>quorum pars parva fui</i>;
for in no way do I wish to dissociate myself from either
such stricture or such praise as may be appropriate to men
who have made a study of science their vocation,&mdash;not
indeed the peaks of the race, but the general body. For it
is safe to assume that we must have some qualities in common,
and that these must be among the causes which have
switched us on to a laborious and materially unremunerative
road.</p>

<p>Michael Foster said in his Presidential Address to the
British Association at Dover:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Men of science have no peculiar virtues, no special
powers. They are ordinary men, their characters are common,
even commonplace. Science, as Huxley said, is organised
common sense, and men of science are common men,
drilled in the ways of common sense."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This of course, like any aphorism, does not bear pressing
unduly: and Dr. Arthur Schuster in a similar Address at
Manchester hedged it round with qualifying clauses:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"This saying of Huxley's has been repeated so often
that one almost wishes it were true; but unfortunately I
cannot find a definition of common sense that fits the phrase.
Sometimes the word is used as if it were identical with
uncommon sense, sometimes as if it were the same thing
as common nonsense. Often it means untrained intelligence,
and in its best aspect it is, I think, that faculty which
recognises that the obvious solution of a problem
is frequently the right one. When, for instance, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[ 369]</a></span>
see during a total solar eclipse red flames shooting out
from the edge of the sun, the obvious explanation is that
these are real phenomena, caused by masses of glowing
vapours ejected from the sun. And when a learned friend
tells me that all this is an optical illusion due to anomalous
refraction, I object on the ground that the explanation
violates my common sense. He replies by giving me the
reasons which have led him to his conclusions; and though
I still believe that I am right, I have to meet him with a
more substantial reply than an appeal to my own convictions.
Against a solid argument common sense has no
power, and must remain a useful but fallible guide which
both leads and misleads all classes of the community
alike."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sound moral of this is, not that a common-sense explanation
is likely to be the right one, or that it necessarily
has any merits if there are sound reasons to oppose to it,
but that the common sense or most obvious and superficial
explanation <i>may</i> turn out to be after all truer as well as
simpler than more recondite hypotheses which have been
substituted for it. In other words&mdash;the straightforward
explanation need not be false.</p>

<p>Now the phenomena encountered in psychical research
have long ago suggested an explanation, in terms of other
than living human intelligences, which may be properly
called spiritistic. Every kind of alternative explanation,
including the almost equally unorthodox one of telepathy
from living people, has been tried: and these attempts have
been necessary and perfectly legitimate. If they had succeeded,
well and good; but inasmuch as in my judgment
there are phenomena which they cannot explain, and inasmuch
as some form of spiritistic hypothesis, given certain
postulates, explains practically all, I have found
myself driven back on what I may call the common-sense
explanation; or, to adopt Dr. Schuster's parable, I consider
that the red flames round the sun are what they
appear to be.</p>

<p>To attribute capricious mechanical performance to the
action of live things, is sufficient as a proximate explanation;
as we saw in the case of the jumping bean, Chapter
I. If the existence of the live thing is otherwise unknown,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[ 370]</a></span>
the explanation may seem forced and unsatisfactory. But
if after trying other hypotheses we find that this only will
fit the case, we may return to it after all with a clear
conscience. That represents the history of my own progress
in Psychical Research.
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Apologia</span></h3>

<p>Meanwhile the attitude of scientific men is perfectly
intelligible; and not unreasonable, except when they forget
their self-imposed limitations and cultivate a baseless negative
philosophy. People who study mechanism of course
find Mechanics, and if the mechanism is physiological
they find Physics and Chemistry as well; but
they are not thereby compelled to deny the existence
of everything else. They need not philosophise
at all, though they should be able to realise their
philosophical position when it is pointed out. The
business of science is to trace out the mode of
action of the laws of Chemistry and Physics, everywhere
and under all circumstances. Those laws appear to be of
universal application throughout the material Universe,&mdash;in
the most distant star as well as on the earth,&mdash;in the
animal organism as well as in inorganic matter; and
the study of their action alone has proved an ample
task.</p>

<p>But scientific workers are sometimes thought to be
philosophising seriously when they should be understood
as really only expressing the natural scope of their special
subject. Laplace, for instance, is often misunderstood,
because, when challenged about the place of God
in his system, he said that he had no need of such a
hypothesis,&mdash;a dictum often quoted as if it were atheistical.
It is not necessarily anything of the kind. As a brief
statement it is right, though rather unconciliatory and blunt.
He was trying to explain astronomy on clear and definite
mechanical principles, and the introduction of a "finger of
God" would have been not only an unwarrantable complication
but a senseless intrusion. Not an intrusion or a complication
in the Universe, be it understood, but in Laplace's
scheme, his <i>Syst�me du Monde</i>. Yet Browning's "flash
of the will that can" in <i>Abt Vogler</i>, with all that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[ 371]</a></span>
the context implies, remains essentially and permanently
true.</p>

<p>Theologians who admit that the Deity always works
through agents and rational means can grant to scientific
workers all that they legitimately claim in the positive
direction, and can encourage them in the detailed study
of those agents and means. If people knew more about
science, and the atmosphere in which scientific men work,
they would be better able to interpret occasional rather
rash negations; which are quite explicable in terms of the
artificial limitation of range which physical science hitherto
has wisely laid down for itself.</p>

<p>It is a true instinct which resents the medi�val practice
of freely introducing occult and unknown causes into working
science. To attribute the rise of sap, for instance, to
a 'vital force' would be absurd, it would be giving up the
problem and stating nothing at all. Progress in science
began when spiritual and transcendental causes were
eliminated and treated as non-existent. The simplicity so
attained was congenial to the scientific type of mind; the
abstraction was eminently useful, and was justified by
results. Yet unknown causes of an immaterial and even
of a spiritual kind may in reality exist, and may influence
or produce phenomena, for all that; and it may have to
be the business of science to discover and begin to attend
to them, as soon as the ordinary solid ground-plan of Nature
has been made sufficiently secure.</p>

<p>Some of us&mdash;whether wisely or unwisely&mdash;now want
to enlarge the recognised scope of physical science, so as
gradually to take a wider purview and include more of the
totality of things. That is what the Society for Psychical
Research was established for,&mdash;to begin extending the range
of scientific law and order, by patient exploration in a
comparatively new region. The effort has been resented,
and at first ridiculed, only because misunderstood. The
effort may be ambitious, but it is perfectly legitimate; and if
it fails it fails.</p>

<p>But advance in new directions may be wisely slow, and
it is readily admissible that Societies devoted to long-established
branches of science are right to resist extraneous
novelties, as long as possible, and leave the study of occult
phenomena to a Society established for the purpose.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[ 372]</a></span>
Outlandish territories may in time be incorporated as States,
but they must make their claim good and become civilised
first.</p>

<p>Yet unfamiliar causes must be introduced occasionally
into systematised knowledge, unless our scrutiny of the
Universe is already exhaustive. Unpalatable facts can be
ruled out from attention, but they cannot without investigation
be denied. Strange facts do really happen, even though
unprovided for in our sciences. Amid their orthodox relations,
they may be regarded as a nuisance. The feeling
they cause is as if capricious or mischievous live things had
been allowed to intrude into the determinate apparatus of
a physical laboratory, thereby introducing hopeless complexity
and appearing superficially to interfere with established
laws. To avoid such alien incursion a laboratory can
be locked, but the Universe can not. And if ever, under
any circumstances, we actually do encounter the interaction
of intelligences other than that of living men, we shall
sooner or later become aware of the fact, and shall ultimately
have to admit it into a more comprehensive scheme
of existence. Early attempts, like those of the present,
must be unsatisfactory and crude; especially as the evidence
is of a kind to which scientific men for the most part are
unaccustomed; so no wonder they are resentful. Still the
evidence is there, and I for one cannot ignore it. Members
of the Society for Psychical Research are aware that the
evidence already published&mdash;the carefully edited and sifted
evidence published by their own organisation&mdash;occupies
some forty volumes of <i>Journal</i> and <i>Proceedings</i>; and some
of them know that a great deal more evidence exists than
has been published, and that some of the best evidence is
not likely to be published,&mdash;not yet at any rate. It stands
to reason that, at the present stage, the best evidence
must often be of a very private and family character.
Many, however, are the persons who are acquainted with
facts in their own experience which appeal to them more
strongly than anything that has ever been published. No
records can surpass first-hand direct experience in
cogency.</p>

<p>Nevertheless we are also aware, or ought to be, that no
one crucial episode can ever be brought forward as deciding
such a matter. That is not the way in which things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[ 373]</a></span>
of importance are proven. Evidence is cumulative, it is
on the strength of a mass of experience that an induction
is ultimately made, and a conclusion provisionally arrived
at; though sometimes it happens that a single exceptionally
strong instance, or series of instances, may clinch it for
some individual.</p>

<p>But indeed the evidence, in one form and another, has
been crudely before the human race from remote antiquity;
only it has been treated in ways more or less obfuscated
by superstition. The same sort of occurrences as
were known to Virgil, and to many another seer&mdash;the same
sort of experiences as are found by folk-lore students,
not only in history but in every part of the earth to-day&mdash;are
happening now in a scientific age, and sometimes under
scientific scrutiny. Hence it is that from the scientific
point of view progress is at length being made; and any
one with a real desire to know the truth need not lack evidence,
if he will first read the records with an open mind,
and then bide his time and be patient till an opportunity
for first-hand critical observation is vouchsafed him. The
opportunity may occur at any time: the readiness is all.
Really clinching evidence in such a case is never in the past;
a <i>prima facie</i> case for investigation is established by the
records, but real conviction must be attained by first-hand
experience in the present.</p>

<p>The things to be investigated are either true or false.
If false, pertinacious inquiry will reveal their falsity. If
true, they are profoundly important. For there are no
half-truths in Nature; every smallest new departure has
portentous consequences; our eyes must open slowly, or
we should be overwhelmed. I once likened the feeling of
physical investigators in the year 1889 to that of a boy
who had long been strumming on the keyboard of a deserted
organ into which an unseen power had begun to blow a
vivifying breath.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
That was at the beginning of the series
of revolutionary discoveries about radiation and the nature
of matter which have since resounded through the world.
And now once more the touch of a finger elicits a responsive
note, and again the boy hesitates, half delighted, half affrighted,
at the chords which it would seem he can now
summon forth almost at will.</p>

<span class="small">OUTLOOK ON THE UNIVERSE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHAT then is the conclusion of the whole matter?
Or rather, what effect have these investigations
had upon my own outlook on the Universe?
The question is not so unimportant as it seems; because
if the facts are to influence others they must have influenced
myself too; and that is the only influence of which
I have first-hand knowledge. It must not be supposed
that my outlook has changed appreciably since the event
and the particular experiences related in the foregoing
pages: my conclusion has been gradually forming itself
for years, though undoubtedly it is based on experience of
the same sort of thing. But this event has strengthened
and liberated my testimony. It can now be associated with
a private experience of my own, instead of with the private
experiences of others. So long as one was dependent on evidence
connected, even indirectly connected, with the bereavement
of others, one had to be reticent and cautious and in
some cases silent. Only by special permission could any
portion of the facts be reproduced; and that permission
might in important cases be withheld. My own deductions
were the same then as they are now, but the facts are
now my own.</p>

<p>One little point of difference, between the time before
and the time after, has however become manifest. In the
old days, if I sat with a medium, I was never told of any
serious imaginary bereavement which had befallen myself&mdash;beyond
the natural and inevitable losses from an older
generation which fall to the lot of every son of man. But
now, if I or any member of my family goes anonymously to
a genuine medium, giving not the slightest normal clue, my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[ 375]</a></span>
son is quickly to the fore and continues his clear and convincing
series of evidences; sometimes giving testimony
of a critically selected kind, sometimes contenting
himself with friendly family chaff and reminiscences,
but always acting in a manner consistent with his
personality and memories and varying moods. If in
any case a given medium had weak power, or if there
were special difficulties encountered on a given occasion,
he is aware of the fact; and he refers to it, when there
is opportunity, through another totally disconnected
medium (cf. Chapter XXI, Part II). In every way
he has shown himself anxious to give convincing
evidence. Moreover, he wants me to speak out; and I
shall.</p>

<p>I am as convinced of continued existence, on the other
side of death, as I am of existence here. It may be said,
you cannot be as sure as you are of sensory experience.
I say I can. A physicist is never limited to direct sensory
impressions, he has to deal with a multitude of conceptions
and things for which he has no physical organ: the dynamical
theory of heat, for instance, and of gases, the theories
of electricity, of magnetism, of chemical affinity, of cohesion,
aye and his apprehension of the Ether itself, lead him
into regions where sight and hearing and touch are impotent
as direct witnesses, where they are no longer efficient
guides. In such regions everything has to be interpreted
in terms of the insensible, the apparently unsubstantial, and
in a definite sense the imaginary. Yet these regions of
knowledge are as clear and vivid to him as are any of those
encountered in everyday occupations; indeed most commonplace
phenomena themselves require interpretation in terms
of ideas more subtle,&mdash;the apparent solidity of matter itself
demands explanation,&mdash;and the underlying non-material
entities of a physicist's conception become gradually
as real and substantial as anything he knows. As Lord
Kelvin used to say, when in a paradoxical mood, we
really know more about electricity than we know about
matter.</p>

<p>That being so, I shall go further and say that I am
reasonably convinced of the existence of grades of being,
not only lower in the scale than man but higher also,
grades of every order of magnitude from zero to infinity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[ 376]</a></span>
And I know by experience that among these beings are
some who care for and help and guide humanity, not disdaining
to enter even into what must seem petty details,
if by so doing they can assist souls striving on their upward
course. And further it is my faith&mdash;however humbly
it may be held&mdash;that among these lofty beings, highest
of those who concern themselves directly with
this earth of all the myriads of worlds in infinite
space, is One on whom the right instinct of Christianity
has always lavished heartfelt reverence and devotion.</p>

<p>Those who think that the day of that Messiah is over
are strangely mistaken: it has hardly begun. In individual
souls Christianity has flourished and borne fruit,
but for the ills of the world itself it is an almost untried
panacea. It will be strange if this ghastly war fosters
and simplifies and improves a knowledge of Christ, and
aids a perception of the ineffable beauty of his life and
teaching: yet stranger things have happened; and, whatever
the Churches may do, I believe that the call of Christ
himself will be heard and attended to, by a large part of
humanity in the near future, as never yet it has been heard
or attended to on earth.</p>

<p>My own time down here is getting short; it matters
little: but I dare not go till I have borne this testimony
to the grace and truth which emanate from that divine
Being,&mdash;the realisation of whose tender-hearted simplicity
and love for man may have been overlaid at times and
almost lost amid well-intentioned but inappropriate dogma,
but who is accessible as always to the humble and
meek.</p>

<p>Intercommunion between the states or grades of existence
is not limited to messages from friends and relatives,
or to conversation with personalities of our own
order of magnitude,&mdash;that is only a small and verifiable
portion of the whole truth,&mdash;intercourse between the states
carries with it occasional, and sometimes unconscious, communion
with lofty souls who have gone before. The truth
of such continued influence corresponds with the highest of
the Revelations vouchsafed to humanity. This truth, when
assimilated by man, means an assurance of the reality of
prayer, and a certainty of gracious sympathy and fellowfeeling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[ 377]</a></span>
from one who never despised the suffering, the
sinful, or the lowly; yea, it means more&mdash;it means nothing
less than the possibility some day of a glance or a word of
approval from the Eternal Christ.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">INVESTIGATION is laborious and unexciting; it takes
years, and progress is slow; but in all regions of knowledge
it is the method which in the long-run has led
towards truth; it is the method by which what we feel to
be solid and substantial progress has always been made. In
many departments of human knowledge this fact is admitted&mdash;though
men of science have had to fight hard for
their method before getting it generally recognised. In
some departments it is still contested, and the arguments
of Bacon in favour of free experimental inquiry are
applicable to those subjects which are claimed as superior
to scientific test.</p>

<p>If it be objected that not by such means is truth in
religious matters ascertained, if it be held that we must
walk by faith, not by sight, and that never by searching
will man find out any of the secrets of God, I do not care
to contest the objection, though I disagree with its negative
portion. That no amount of searching will ever enable
us to find out the Almighty to perfection is manifestly true;
that secrets may be revealed to inspired 'babes' which are
hidden from the wise and prudent is likewise certain; but
that no secret things of God can be brought to light by patient
examination and inquiry into facts is false, for you
cannot parcel out truth into that which is divine and that
which is not divine; the truths of science were as much
God's secrets as any other, and they have yielded up their
mystery to precisely the process which is called in
question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[ 379]</a></span></p></div>

<p>We are part of the Universe, our senses have been
evolved in and by it; it follows that they are harmonious
with it, and that the way it appeals to our senses is a true
way; though their obvious limitation entitles us to expect
from time to time fresh discoveries of surprising and fundamental
novelty, and a growing perception of tracts beyond
our ancient ken.</p>

<p>Some critics there are, however, who, calling themselves
scientific, have made up their minds in a negative
direction and a contrary sense. These are impressed not
only with the <i>genuineness</i> of the truth afforded us through
our senses and perceptions, but with its <i>completeness</i>; they
appear to think that the main lines of research have already
been mapped out or laid down, they will not believe that
regions other than those to which they are accustomed can
be open to scientific exploration; especially they imagine
that in the so-called religious domain there can be no guides
except preconception and prejudice. Accordingly, they appear
to disbelieve that anyone can be conscientiously taking
trouble to grope his way by patient inquiry, with the aid
of such clues as are available; and in order to contradict
the results of such inquiry they fall into the habit of doing
that of which they accuse the workers,&mdash;they appeal to
sentiment and presumption. They talk freely about what
they believe, what they think unlikely, and what is impossible.
They are governed by prejudice; their minds are
made up. Doubtless they regard knowledge on certain
topics as inaccessible, so they are positive and selfsatisfied
and opinionated and quite sure. They pride
themselves on their hard-headed scepticism and robust
common sense; while the truth is that they have bound
themselves into a narrow cell by walls of sentiment, and
have thus excluded whole regions of human experience from
their purview.
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>It so happens that I have been engaged for over forty
years in mathematical and physical science, and for more
than half that period in exploration into unusual psychical
development, as opportunity arose; and I have thus been
led to certain tentative conclusions respecting permissible
ways of regarding the universe.</p>

<p>First, I have learned to regard the universe as a concrete
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[ 380]</a></span>
and full-bodied reality, with parts accessible and intelligible
to us, all of it capable of being understood and
investigated by the human mind, not as an abstraction or
dream-like entity whose appearances are deceptive. Our
senses do not deceive us; their testimony is true as far as
it goes. I have learned to believe in Intelligibility.</p>

<p>Next, that everything, every single thing, has many
aspects. Even such a thing as water, for instance. Water,
regarded by the chemist, is an assemblage or aggregate of
complex molecules; regarded by the meteorologist and
physiographer, it is an element of singular and vitally important
properties; every poet has treated of some aspect
of beauty exhibited by this common substance; while to
the citizen it is an ordinary need of daily life. All the
aspects together do not exhaust the subject, but each of
them is real. The properties of matter of which our senses
tell us, or enable us to inquire into in laboratories, are true
properties, real and true. They are not the whole truth, a
great deal more is known about them by men of science, but
the more complex truths do not make the simpler ones false.
Moreover, we must admit that the whole truth about the
simplest thing is assuredly beyond us; the Thing-in-itself
is related to the whole universe, and in its fulness is incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I have learned that while positive assertions
on any given subject are often true, error creeps
in when simple aspects are denied in order to emphasise
the more complex, or <i>vice versa</i>. A trigonometrical sine,
for instance, may be expressed in terms of imaginary
exponentials in a way familiar to all mathematical
students; also as an infinite series of fractions with increasing
factorials in the denominators; also in a number
of other true and legitimate and useful ways; but the simple
geometrical definition, by aid of the chord of a
circle or the string of a bow, survives them all, and is true
too.</p>

<p>So it is, I venture to say, with the concept God.</p>

<p>It can be regarded from some absolute and transcendental
standpoint which humanity can only pretend to attain
to. It can be regarded as the highest and best idea
which the human mind has as yet been able to form. It
can be regarded as dominating and including all existence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[ 381]</a></span>
and as synonymous with all existence when that is made
sufficiently comprehensive. All these views are legitimate,
but they are not final or complete. God can also be represented
by some of the attributes of humanity, and can
be depicted as a powerful and loving Friend with whom our
spirits may commune at every hour of the day, one whose
patience and wisdom and long-suffering and beneficence are
never exhausted. He can, in fact, be regarded as displayed
to us, in such fashion as we can make use of, in
the person of an incarnate Being who came for the express
purpose of revealing to man such attributes of deity as
would otherwise have been missed.</p>

<p>The images are not mutually exclusive, they may all be
in some sort true. None of them is complete. They are
all aspects&mdash;partly true and partly false as conceived by
any individual, but capable of being expressed so as to be,
as far as they go, true.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the Christian idea of God is the simple
one. Overpoweringly and appallingly simple is the notion
presented to us by the orthodox Christian Churches:&mdash;</p>

<p>A babe born of poor parents, born in a stable among
cattle because there was no room for them in the village
inn&mdash;no room for them in the inn&mdash;what a master touch!
Revealed to shepherds. Religious people inattentive. Royalty
ignorant, or bent on massacre. A glimmering perception,
according to one noble legend, attained in the Far
East&mdash;where also similar occurrences have been narrated.
Then the child growing into a peasant youth, brought up to
a trade. At length a few years of itinerant preaching;
flashes of miraculous power and insight. And then a swift
end: set upon by the religious people; his followers overawed
and scattered, himself tried as a blasphemer, flogged,
and finally tortured to death.</p>

<p>Simplicity most thorough and most strange! In itself it
is not unique; such occurrences seem inevitable to highest
humanity in an unregenerate world; but who, without inspiration,
would see in them a revelation of the nature of
God? The life of Buddha, the life of Joan of Arc, are not
thus regarded. Yet the Christian revelation is clear enough
and true enough if our eyes are open, and if we care to read
and accept the simple record which, whatever its historical
value, is all that has been handed down to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[ 382]</a></span></p>

<p>Critics often object that there have been other attempted
Messiahs, that the ancient world was expectant of a Divine
Incarnation. True enough. But what then? We need
not be afraid of an idea because it has several times striven
to make itself appreciated. It is foolish to decline a revelation
because it has been more than once offered to
humanity. Every great revelation is likely to have been
foreshadowed in more or less imperfect forms, so as to prepare
our minds and make ready the way for complete perception
hereafter. It is probable that the human race is
quite incompetent to receive a really great idea the first
time it is offered. There must be many failures to effect
an entrance before the final success, many struggles to overcome
natural obstacles and submerge the stony products
of human stolidity. Lapse of time for preparation is required
before anything great can be permanently accomplished,
and repeated attempts are necessary; but the tide
of general progress is rising all the time. The idea is well
expressed in Clough's familiar lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem width24">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"For while the tired waves, vainly breaking,</p>
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seem here no painful inch to gain,</span></p>
<p>Far back, through creeks and inlets making,</p>
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Comes silent, flooding in, the main."</span></p>
</div></div></div>

<p>So it was with the idea of the Messiah which was abroad
in the land, and had been for centuries, before Christ's
coming; and never has he been really recognised by more
than a few. Dare we not say that he is more truly recognised
now than in any previous age in the history of the
Church&mdash;except perhaps the very earliest? And I doubt
if we need make that exception.</p>

<p>The idea of his Messiahship gradually dawned upon him,
and he made no mistake as to his mission:&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:4em;">The word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's
who sent me.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left:4em;">As the Father gave me commandment, even so I do.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left:4em;">The words which I say unto you I speak not of myself;
the Father which dwelleth in me, he doeth the
works.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left:4em;">The Father is greater than I.</span></p>

<p>But, for all that,</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:4em;">He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[ 383]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, truly, Christ was a planetary manifestation of Deity,
a revelation to the human race, the highest and simplest it
has yet had; a revelation in the only form accessible
to man, a revelation in the full-bodied form of
humanity.</p>

<p>Little conception had they in those days of the whole
universe as we know it now. The earth was the whole
world to them, and that which revealed God to the earth
was naturally regarded as the whole Cosmic Deity. Yet
it was a truly divine Incarnation.</p>

<p>A deity of some kind is common to every branch of the
human race. It seems to be possessed by every savage,
overawed as he necessarily is by the forces of nature. Caprice,
jealousy, openness to flattery and rewards, are likewise
parts of early theology. Then in the gods of Olympus&mdash;that
poetic conception which rose to such heights and fell
to such depths at different epochs in the ancient world&mdash;the
attributes of power and beauty were specially emphasised.
<i>Power</i> is common to all deities, and favouritism in its use
seems also a natural supposition to early tribes; but the
element of <i>Beauty</i>, as a divine attribute, we in these islands,
save for the poets, have largely lost or forgotten&mdash;to our
great detriment. In Jehovah, however, the Hebrew race
rose to a conception of divine <i>Righteousness</i> which we have
assimilated and permanently retained; and upon that foundation
Christianity was grafted. It was to a race who
had risen thus far&mdash;a race with a genius for theology&mdash;that
the Christian revelation came. It was rendered possible,
though only just possible, by the stage attained. Simple
and unknown folk were ready to receive it, or, at least,
were willing to take the first steps to learn.</p>

<p>The power, the righteousness, and other worthy attributes
belonging to Jehovah, were known of old. The Christian
conception takes <i>them</i> for granted, and concentrates
attention on the pity, the love, the friendliness, the compassion,
the earnest desire to help mankind&mdash;attributes
which, though now and again dimly discerned by one or
another of the great seers of old, had not yet been thrown
into concrete form.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>People sometimes seek to deny such attributes as are
connoted by the word 'Personality' in the Godhead&mdash;they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[ 384]</a></span>
say it is a human conception. Certainly it is a human conception;
it is through humanity that it has been revealed.
Why seek to deny it? God transcends personality, objectors
say. By all means: transcends all our conceptions
infinitely, transcends every revelation which has ever been
vouchsafed; but the revelations are true as far as they go,
for all that.</p>

<p>Let us not befog ourselves by attempting impossible
conceptions to such an extent that we lose the simple and
manifest reality. No conception that we can make is too
high, too good, too worthy. It is easy to imagine ourselves
mistaken, but never because ideas are too high or too good.
It were preposterous to imagine an over-lofty conception in
a creature. Reality is always found to exceed our clear
conception of it; never once in science has it permanently
fallen short. No conception is too great or too high. But
also no devout conception is too simple, too lowly,
too childlike to have an element&mdash;some grain&mdash;of
vital truth stored away, a mustard seed ready to
germinate and bud, a leaven which may permeate
the whole mass.</p>

<p>I would apply all this to what for brevity may be called
Human Immortality. It is possible to think of that rather
simply; and, on the other hand, it is possible to confuse
ourselves with tortuous thoughts till it seems unreal and
impossible. It is part of the problem of personality and
individuality; for the question of how far these are dependent
on the bodily organism, or whether they can exist
without it, is a scientific question. It is open to research.
And yet it is connected with Christianity; for undoubtedly
the Christian idea of God involves a belief in human immortality.
If <i>per impossible</i> this latter could be authoritatively
denied, a paralysing blow would have been struck
at the Christian idea. On the other hand, if by scientific investigation
the persistence of individual memory and character
were proved, a great step in the direction of orthodox
theology would have been taken.</p>

<p>The modern superstition about the universe is that,
being suffused with law and order, it contains nothing personal,
nothing indeterminate, nothing unforeseen; that there
is no room for the free activity of intelligent beings, that
everything is mechanically determined; so that given the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[ 385]</a></span>
velocity and acceleration and position of every atom at any
instant, the whole future could be unravelled by sufficient
mathematical power.</p>

<p>The doctrines of Uniformity and Determinism are supposed
to be based upon experience. But experience includes
experience of the actions of human beings; and some
of them certainly appear to be of a capricious and undetermined
character. Or without considering human beings,
watch the orbits of a group of flies as they play; they are
manifestly not controlled completely by mechanical laws
as are the motions of the planets. The simplest view of
their activity is that it is self-determined, that they are flying
about at their own will, and turning when and where
they choose. The conservation of energy has nothing to say
against it. Here we see free-will in its simplest form. To
suppose anything else in such a case, to suppose that every
twist could have been predicted through all eternity, is to
introduce pr�ternatural complexity, and is quite unnecessary.</p>

<p>Why not assume, what is manifestly the truth, that
free-will exists and has to be reckoned with, that the universe
is not a machine subject to outside forces, but a living
organism with initiations of its own; and that the
laws which govern it, though they include mechanical and
physical and chemical laws, are not limited to those,
but involve other and higher abstractions, which may
perhaps some day be formulated, for life and mind and
spirit?</p>

<p>If it be said that free-will can be granted to deity but
to nothing lower, inasmuch as the Deity must be aware
of all that is going to happen, I reply that you are now
making a hypothesis of a complicated kind, and going
beyond knowledge into speculation. But if still the
speculation appears reasonable, that only the Deity can
be endowed with free-will, it merely opens the question,
What shall be included in that term? If freedom is the
characteristic mark of deity, then those are justified who
have taught that every fragment of mind and will is
a contributory element in the essence of the Divine
Being.</p>

<p>How, then, can we conceive of deity? The analogy of
the human body and its relation to the white corpuscles in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[ 386]</a></span>
its blood is instructive. Each corpuscle is a living-creature
endowed with the powers of locomotion, of assimilation,
and, under certain conditions now being inquired into,
of reproduction by fission. The health and polity of the
body are largely dependent on the activity of these phagocytes.
They are to us extremely important; they are an
essential part of our being.</p>

<p>But now suppose one of these corpuscles endowed with
intelligence&mdash;what conception of the universe will it be able
to form? It may examine its surroundings, discourse of
the vessels through which it passes, of the adventures it
encounters; and if philosophically minded, it may speculate
on a being of which perhaps it and all its like form a part&mdash;an
immanent deity, whose constituents they are, a being
which includes them and includes all else which they know
or can imagine&mdash;a being to whose existence they contribute,
and whose purposes they serve or share. So far they could
speculate, and so far they would be right. But if they proceeded
further, and entered on negations, if they surmised
that that immanent aspect of the universe in which they
lived and moved and had their being was the sole and only
aspect, if they surmised that there was no personality, no
feeling, no locomotion, no mind, no purpose, apart from
them and their kind, they would greatly err. What
conception could they ever form of the manifold
interests and activities of man? Still less of the
universe known to man, of which he himself forms so
trivial a portion.</p>

<p>All analogies fail at some point, but they are a help
nevertheless, and this analogy will bear pressing rather far.
We ourselves are a part of the agencies for good or evil;
we have the power to help or to hinder, to mend or to mar,
within the scope of our activity. Our help is asked for;
lowly as we are, it is really wanted, on the earth here and
now, just as much wanted as our body needs the help of
its lowly white corpuscles&mdash;to contribute to health, to attack
disease, to maintain the normal and healthy life of the organism.
We are the white corpuscles of the cosmos, we
serve and form part of an immanent Deity.</p>

<p>Truly it is no easy service to which we are called;
something of the wisdom of the serpent must enter into
our activities; sanity and moral dignity and sound sense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[ 387]</a></span>
must govern our proceedings; all our powers must be called
out, and there must be no sluggishness. Impulses, even
good impulses, alone are not sufficient; every faculty of
the human brain must be exerted, and we must be continually
on guard against the flabbiness of mere good
intentions.</p>

<p>Our activity and service are thus an integral part of
the Divine Existence, which likewise includes that of all
the perceptible universe. But to suppose that this exhausts
the matter, and that the Deity has no transcendent Existence
of which we can form no idea,&mdash;to suppose that what
happens is not the result of his dominant and controlling
Personality, is to step beyond legitimate inference, and to
treat appearance as exhaustive of reality.</p>

<p>Always mistrust negations. They commonly signify
blindness and prejudice&mdash;except when thoroughly established
and carefully formulated in the light of actual experience
or mathematical proof. And even then we
should be ready to admit the possibility of higher
generalisations which may uproot them. They are
only safe when thrown into the form of a positive
assertion.</p>

<p>The impossibility of squaring the circle is not really a
negative proposition, except in form. It is safer and more
convincing when thrown into the positive and definite form
that the ratio of area to diameter is incommensurable. That
statement is perfectly clear and legitimate; and the illustration
may be used as a parable. A positive form should
be demanded of every comprehensive denial; and whatever
cannot be thrown into positive form, it is wise to mistrust.
Its promulgator is probably stepping out of bounds, into
the cheap and easy region of negative speculation. He is
like a rationalistic microbe denying the existence of a human
being.</p>

<p>I have urged that the simple aspect of things is to be
considered and not despised; but, for the majority of people,
is not the tendency the other way? Are they not too
much given to suppose the Universe limited to the simplicity
of their first and everyday conception of it? The stockbroker
has his idea of the totality of things; the navvy has
his. Students of mathematical physics are liable to think
of it as a determinate assemblage of atoms and ether, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[ 388]</a></span>
no room for spiritual entities&mdash;no room, as my brilliant
teacher, W. K. Clifford, expressed it, no room
for ghosts.</p>

<p>Biological students are apt to think of life as a physicochemical
process of protoplasmic structure and cell organisation,
with consciousness as an epiphenomenon. They
watch the lowly stages of animal organisms, and hope to
imitate their behaviour by judicious treatment of inorganic
materials. By all means let them try; the effort
is entirely legitimate, and not unhopeful. That which has
come into being in the past may come into being under
observation in the present, and the intelligence and co-operation
of man may help. Why not? The material
vehicle would thus have been provided&mdash;in this case,
without doubt, purposely and designedly&mdash;for some incipient
phase of life. But would that in the least explain the
nature of life and mind and will, and reduce them to simple
atomic mechanism and dynamics? Not a whit. The
real nature of these things would remain an unanswered
question.</p>

<p>During the past century progress has lain chiefly in the
domain of the mechanical and material. The progress has
been admirable, and has led to natural rejoicing and
legitimate pride. It has also led to a supposition that all
possible scientific advance lies in this same direction, or
even that all the great fundamental discoveries have now
been made! Discovery proceeds by stages, and enthusiasm
at the acquisition of a step or a landing-place obscures
for a time our perception of the flight of stairs immediately
ahead; but it is rational to take a more comprehensive
view.</p>

<p>Part of our experience is the connexion of spirit with
matter. We are conscious of our own identity, our own
mind and purpose and will: we are also conscious of the
matter in which it is at present incarnate and manifested.
Let us use these experiences and learn from them. Incarnation
is a fact; we are not matter, yet we utilise it.
Through the mechanism of the brain we can influence the
material world; we are in it, but not of it; we transcend
it by our consciousness. The body is our machine, our
instrument, our vehicle of manifestation; and through it
we can achieve results in the material sphere. Why seek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[ 389]</a></span>
to deny either the spiritual or the material? Both are
real, both are true. In some higher mind, perhaps, they
may be unified: meanwhile we do not possess this higher
mind. Scientific progress is made by accepting realities
and learning from them; the rest is speculation. It is not
likely that we are the only intelligent beings in the Universe.
There may be many higher grades, up to the
Divine; just as there are lower grades, down to the
am&oelig;ba. Nor need all these grades of intelligence be
clothed in matter or inhabit the surface of a planet. That
is the kind of existence with which we are now familiar,
truly, and anything beyond that is for the most part supersensuous;
but our senses are confessedly limited,
and if there is any truth in the doctrine of human immortality
the existence of myriads of departed individuals
must be assumed, on what has been called "the other
side."</p>

<p>But how are we to get evidence in favour of such an
apparently gratuitous hypothesis? Well, speaking for myself
and with full and cautious responsibility, I have to
state that as an outcome of my investigation into psychical
matters I have at length and quite gradually become convinced,
after more than thirty years of study, not only
that persistent individual existence is a fact, but that
occasional communication across the chasm&mdash;with difficulty
and under definite conditions&mdash;is possible.</p>

<p>This is not a subject on which one comes lightly and
easily to a conclusion, nor can the evidence be explained
except to those who will give to it time and careful study;
but clearly the conclusion is either folly and self-deception,
or it is a truth of the utmost importance to humanity&mdash;and
of importance to us in connexion with our present subject.
For it is a conclusion which cannot stand alone. Mistaken
or true, it affords a foothold for a whole range of
other thoughts, other conclusions, other ideas: false and
misleading if the foothold is insecure, worthy of attention
if the foothold is sound. Let posterity judge.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it is a subject that attracts cranks and
charlatans. Rash opinions are freely expressed on
both sides. I call upon the educated of the younger
generation to refrain from accepting assertions without
severe scrutiny, and, above all, to keep an open mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[ 390]</a></span></p>

<p>If departed human beings can communicate with us,
can advise us and help us, can have any influence on our
actions,&mdash;then clearly the doors are open to a wealth
of spiritual intercourse beyond what we have yet
imagined.</p>

<p>The region of the miraculous, it is called, and the bare
possibility of its existence has been hastily and illegitimately
denied. But so long as we do not imagine it to be
a region denuded of a law and order of its own, akin to the
law and order of the psychological realm, our denial has
no foundation. The existence of such a region may be
established by experience; its non-existence cannot be established,
for non-experience might merely mean that owing to
deficiencies of our sense organs it was beyond our ken. In
judging of what are called miracles we must be guided by
historical evidence and literary criticism. We need not
urge <i>a priori</i> objections to them on scientific grounds. They
need be no more impossible, no more lawless, than the interference
of a human being would seem to a colony of ants or
bees.</p>

<p>The Christian idea of God certainly has involved, and
presumably always will involve, an element of the miraculous,&mdash;a
flooding of human life with influences which lie
outside it, a controlling of human destiny by higher and
beneficent agencies. By evil agencies too? Yes, the influences
are not all on one side; but the Christian faith is
that the good are the stronger. Experience has shown to
many a saint, however tormented by evil, that appeal to
the powers of good can result in ultimate victory. Let us
not reject experience on the ground of dogmatic assertion
and baseless speculation.</p>

<p>Historical records tell us of a Divine Incarnation. We
may consider it freely on historical grounds. We are not
debarred from contemplating such a thing by anything
that science has to say to the contrary. Science does not
speak directly on the subject. If the historical evidence
is good we may credit it, just as we may credit the
hypothesis of survival if the present-day evidence is good.
It sounds too simple and popular an explanation&mdash;too much
like the kind of ideas suited to unsophisticated man and to
the infancy of the race. True; but has it not happened
often in the history of science that reality has been found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[ 391]</a></span>
simpler than our attempted conception of it? Electricity
long ago was often treated as a fluid; and a little time ago
it was customary to jeer at the expression&mdash;legitimate in
the mouth of Benjamin Franklin, but now apparently outgrown.
And yet what else is the crowd of mobile electrons,
postulated by [not] the very latest theory, in a metal?
Surely it is in some sense a fluid, though not a material
one? The guess was not so far wrong after all. Meanwhile
we learned to treat it by mathematical devices, vector
potential, and other recondite methods. With great
veneration I speak of the mathematical physicists of
the past century. They have been almost superhuman in
power, and have attained extraordinary results, but in time
the process of discovery will enable mankind to apprehend
all these things more simply. Progress lies in
simple investigation as well as in speculation and thought
up to the limits of human power; and when things are
really understood, they are perceived to be fairly simple
after all.</p>

<p>So it seems likely to be with a future state, or our own
permanent existence; it has been thought of and spoken
of as if it were altogether transcendental&mdash;something beyond
space and time (as it may be), something outside
and beyond all conception. But it is not necessarily so at
all; it is a question of fact; it is open to investigation. I
find part of it turning out quite reasonably simple; not
easy to grasp or express, for lack of experience and language&mdash;that
is true,&mdash;but not by any means conveying a
feeling of immediate vast difference and change. Something
much more like terrestrial existence, at least on one
aspect of it, than we had imagined. Not as a rule associated
with matter; no, but perhaps associated with ether&mdash;an
etherial body instead of a material one; certainly a
body, or mode of manifestation, of some kind. It appears
to be a state which leaves personality and character and intelligence
much where it was. No sudden jump into something
supernal, but steady and continued progress. Many
activities and interests beyond our present ken, but
with a surviving terrestrial aspect, occasionally accessible,
and showing interest in the doings of those
on earth, together with great desire to help and to
encourage all efforts for the welfare of the race. We need
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[ 392]</a></span>
not search after something so far removed from humanity
as to be unintelligible.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So likewise with the idea of God.</p>

<p>No matter how complex and transcendentally vast the
Reality must be, the Christian conception of God is humanly
simple. It appeals to the unlettered and ignorant; it appeals
to "babes."</p>

<p>That is the way with the greatest things. The sun is
the centre of the solar system, a glorious object full of
mystery and unknown forces, but the sunshine is a friendly
and homely thing, which shines in at a cottage window,
touches common objects with radiance, and brings warmth
and comfort even to the cat.</p>

<p>The sunshine is not the sun, but it is the human and
terrestrial aspect of the sun; it is that which matters in
daily life. It is independent of study and discovery; it
is given us by direct experience, and for ordinary life it
suffices.</p>

<p>Thus would I represent the Christian conception of
God. Christ is the human and practical and workaday
aspect. Christ is the sunshine&mdash;that fraction of transcendental
Cosmic Deity which suffices for the earth. Jesus of
Nazareth is plainly a terrestrial heritage. His advent is
the glory, His reception the shame, of the human race.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Once more, then. Although there may be undue simplification
of the complex, there is also an undue complication
of the simple; it is easy to invent unnecessary problems, to
manufacture gratuitous difficulties, to lose our way in a
humanly constructed and quite undivine fog. But the
way is really simple, and when the fog lifts and the
sunshine appears, all becomes clear and we proceed
without effort on our way: the wayfaring man, though a
fool, need not err therein. The way, the truth, and the
life are all one. Reality is always simple; it is concrete
and real and expressible. Our customary view of the commonest
objects is not indeed the last word, nay, rather,
it is the first word, as to their nature; but it is a true word
as far as it goes. Analysing a liquid into a congeries of
discrete atoms does not destroy or weaken or interfere
with its property or fluidity. Analysing an atom into electrons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[ 393]</a></span>
does not destroy the atom. Reducing matter to
electricity, or to any other etherial substratum, does not
alter the known and familiarly utilised properties of a bit
of wood or iron or glass, in the least; no, nor of a bit of
bone or feather or flesh. Study may superadd properties
imperceptible to the plain man, but the plain man's concrete
and simple view serves for ordinary purposes of daily
life.</p>

<p>And God's view, strange to say, must be more akin to
that of the plain man than to that of the philosopher or
statistician. That is how it comes that children are near
the kingdom of heaven. It is not likely that God really
makes abstractions and "geometrises." All those higher
and elaborate modes of expression are human counters;
and the difficulties of dealing with them are human too.
Only in early stages do things require superhuman power
for their apprehension; they are easy to grasp when they
are really understood. They come out then into daily life;
they are not then matters of intellectual strain; they can
appeal to our sense of beauty; they can affect us with
emotion and love and appreciation and joy; they can enter
into poetry and music, and constitute the subject-matter of
Art of all kinds. The range of art and of enjoyment must
increase infinitely with perfect knowledge. This is the
atmosphere of God. "Where dwells enjoyment, there is
He." We are struggling upwards into that atmosphere
slowly and laboriously. The struggle is human, and for
us quite necessary, but the mountain top is serene and
pure and lovely, and its beauty is in nowise enhanced by
the efforts of the exhausted climber, as he slowly wins his
way thither.</p>

<p>Yet the effort itself is of value. The climber, too, is part
of the scheme, and his upward trend may be growth
and gain to the whole. It adds interest, though not
beauty. Do not let us think that the universe is stagnant
and fixed and settled and dull, and that all its appearance
of "going on" is illusion and deception. I would
even venture to urge that, ever since the grant to
living creatures of free will, there must be, in some sense
or other, a real element of contingency,&mdash;that there is no
dulness about it, even to the Deity, but a constant and
aspiring Effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[ 394]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us trust our experience in this also. The Universe
is a flux, it is a becoming, it is a progress. Evolution is
a reality. True and not imaginary progress is possible.
Effort is not a sham. Existence is a true adventure. There
is a real risk.</p>

<p>There was a real risk about creation&mdash;directly it went
beyond the inert and mechanical. The granting of choice
and free will involved a risk. Thenceforward things could
go wrong. They might be kept right by main force, but
that would not be playing the game, that would not be
loyalty to the conditions.</p>

<p>As William James says: A football team desire to get
a ball to a certain spot, but that is not all they desire; they
wish to do it under certain conditions and overcome inherent
difficulties&mdash;else might they get up in the night and put
it there.</p>

<p>So also we may say, Good is the end and aim of the
Divine Being; but not without conditions. Not by compulsion.
Perfection as of machinery would be too dull and
low an achievement&mdash;something much higher is sought. The
creation of free creatures who, in so far as they go right,
do so because they will, not because they must,&mdash;that was
the Divine problem, and it is the highest of which we have
any conception.</p>

<p>Yes, there was a real risk in making a human race on
this planet. Ultimate good was not guaranteed. Some parts
of the Universe must be far better than this, but some may
be worse. Some planets may comparatively fail.
The power of evil may here and there get the
upper hand: although it must ultimately lead to
suicidal destructive failure, for evil is pregnant with
calamity.</p>

<p>This planet is surely not going to fail. Its destinies
have been more and more entrusted to us. For millions
of years it laboured, and now it has produced a human
race&mdash;a late-comer to the planet, only recently arrived, only
partly civilised as yet. But already it has produced Plato
and Newton and Shakespeare; yes, and it has been the
dwelling-place of Christ. Surely it is going to succeed, and
in good time to be the theatre of such a magnificent development
of human energy and power and joy as to compensate,
and more than compensate, for all the pain and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[ 395]</a></span>
suffering, all the blood and tears, which have gone to prepare
the way.</p>

<p>The struggle is a real one. The effort is not confined
to humanity alone: according to the Christian conception
God has shared in it. "God so loved the world that He
gave"&mdash;we know the text. The earth's case was not hopeless;
the world was bad, but it could be redeemed; and the
redemption was worth the painful effort which then was
undergone, and which the disciples of the Cross have since
in their measure shared. Aye, that is the Christian conception;
not of a God apart from His creatures, looking on,
taking no personal interest in their behaviour, sitting aloof
only to judge them; but One who anxiously takes measures
for their betterment, takes trouble, takes pains&mdash;a pregnant
phrase, takes pains,&mdash;One who suffers when they go
wrong, One who feels painfully the miseries and wrongdoings
and sins and cruelties of the creatures whom He
has endowed with free will; One who actively enters into
the storm and the conflict; One who actually took flesh and
dwelt among us, to save us from the slough into which we
might have fallen, to show us what the beauty and dignity
of man might be.</p>

<p>Well, it is a great idea, a great and simple idea, so
simple as to be incredible to some minds. It has been
hidden from many of the wise and prudent; it has been
revealed to babes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To sum up: Let us not be discouraged by simplicity.
Real things are simple. Human conceptions are not altogether
misleading. Our view of the Universe is a partial
one but is not an untrue one. Our knowledge of the conditions
of existence is not altogether false&mdash;only inadequate.
The Christian idea of God is a genuine representation of
reality.</p>

<p>Nor let us imagine that existence hereafter, removed
from these atoms of matter which now both confuse and
manifest it, will be something so wholly remote and different
as to be unimaginable; but let us learn by the testimony
of experience&mdash;either our own or that of others&mdash;that
those who have been, still are; that they care for us
and help us; that they, too, are progressing and learning
and working and hoping; that there are grades of existence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[ 396]</a></span>
stretching upward and upward to all eternity; and that God
Himself, through His agents and messengers, is continually
striving and working and planning, so as to bring this creation
of His through its preparatory labour and pain, and
lead it on to an existence higher and better than anything we
have ever known.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
